WASHINGTON — On Tuesday, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton released an "Initiative on Technology & Innovation,” outlining her policy priorities on internet freedom, economic development, broadband expansion, consumer privacy and other issues.

Free Press Action Fund President and CEO **Craig Aaron** made the following statement:

"We're encouraged that Hillary Clinton is making the internet's future a top priority in her campaign. The internet is no longer a luxury for Americans: It's a necessity in our daily lives. The issues highlighted by Clinton today matter greatly to millions and millions of internet voters.

"There's a lot for internet voters to like in this platform — from a strong stand for Net Neutrality to a desire to close the digital divide. There are also shortcomings and missing details. We need all candidates to take stronger positions against unchecked government surveillance. And we need them to put forward specific plans that will increase competition, lower broadband prices, and protect our privacy.

"Millions of internet users, advocacy groups, and businesses large and small came together to fight for real Net Neutrality rules over the past decade. We are pleased to see Clinton's commitment to defending and enforcing the FCC's open internet rules in the United States. We also welcome her continued interest in fighting for internet freedom abroad.

"Clinton makes a commitment to connect all Americans to fast and affordable broadband by 2020. We are pleased to see her support efforts to address the digital divide with programs like Lifeline and the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program. But the next president can and must do more to address the lack of broadband competition and affordability that prevents tens of millions of Americans from accessing this critical service.

"We urge the Clinton campaign to do more to recognize Americans' serious concerns about unchecked spying and surveillance. Rejecting the false choice between privacy interests and keeping Americans safe means committing to change the PATRIOT Act policies that have targeted innocent people for unwarranted surveillance.

"Unfortunately, her initiative lacks details on how a future Clinton administration would protect the privacy rights of everyday people. Government and corporate surveillance chill speech and present grave privacy concerns for internet users. Dragnet surveillance programs and the targeted surveillance of communities of color present substantial threats to our civil liberties, and government attempts to create encryption backdoors leave everyone much less secure.

"Now that Clinton has released her internet and technology priorities, we ask presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to do the same. Voters need to know where the candidates stand on these crucial issues."
