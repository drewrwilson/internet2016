Goal for training today:

What we don't have to do:
 * configure drupal or wordpress
 * set up a database
 * hosting or database
 * Free
 * very little upkeep

 * show how code is structured
 * pass content piece over to dutch

things I need each of those icons:
 * images for headers

Todo:
 * done - add action fund logo to footer
 * done - add donate link to footer

 * font heirarchy in css

 * Add some validation to the form
 * add css to force the size for icons on toolkit list page


 * add content blog post

 * toolkits icons (content)
 * privacy policy page (content, I'll use single_toolkit as a template)
 * put all text content on github (content)
 * embed two tweets on the frontpage (content)
 * add images to headers (content)

Review updates:

What we're not looking for:
 * any text styling: fonts, colors, size
 * images

What we are looking for:
 * any kinds of content that is missing on any page
 * any glaring problems

Things to teach
  * how to run the website locally
  * how to use github
    * I'd recommend using atom as your text editor
  * how to add a new blog post

Process left:
 * These templates are 90% done: frontpage, toolkit_list, toolkit_single, blog_post, blogpost_single
 * Now I'm working on the policy platform page, which is a little more complicated
 * I still need to do font heirarchy and text styling on all pages
 * We need to put in all content (blog posts, toolkits, icons, images)
 * Need to test integration w/ ActionKit
 * A quick review with Candace, Dutch, Misty and Rob where we make a final list of any revisions
 * Make those revisions
 * Put it online


Tasks for a possible future revision:
  * Share your story page. Campaign?
  * Any calls to action on blog post or toolkit pages (eg timed modal window, sign up call out section, etc)
  * Any more in-depth social media stuff on the frontpage
  * Adding Craig's youtube video
