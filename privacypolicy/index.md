Internet2016 is a project of the Free Press Action Fund. The Free Press Action Fund is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our websites, as well as that of our members and activists. In fact, we support enhanced protections for everyone’s electronic and Internet privacy.

In this policy, “Free Press Action Fund” refers to Free Press Action Fund staff, board members, cooperating attorneys, interns, volunteers, software providers, vendors and consultants.

In general, the Free Press Action Fund and our software partners treat your contact information as private and confidential. Free Press Action Fund will not give, sell, rent, exchange or otherwise share your information with anyone else without your prior consent except as compelled by law (see below).

We will notify users of updates to this policy by noting the date of new changes directly below this statement.

This policy was last amended on September 10, 2015

Policy effective September 10, 2015

**Website Policies**

Free Press Action Fund and third-party vendor servers may record the IP address of your computer; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked to our site.

We use this information to measure the number of visitors to different sections of the site, to diagnose and correct system errors and to improve the site. We do not connect this information to your name or identity, and we do not retain this information permanently.

Information that is not provided with the express intent of subscription, ordering, membership or donation will not be captured for use in other communications unless otherwise noted. We (and our vendors) restrict the use of “cookies” on this site primarily to convenience features such as auto login, surveys and polls. We typically delete these cookies as soon as is reasonably possible. We’re committed to respecting your desire to opt out of online-tracking schemes, and therefore we include no third-party tracking buttons or beacons on our sites.

**External Links**

Free Press Action Fund has not reviewed all of the sites linked to this site and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any off-site pages or any other sites linked to this site, whether or not they are affiliated with Free Press Action Fund. Such linked sites are for your convenience only and you access them at your own risk. Free Press Action Fund makes no representations or warranties as to the accuracy or functioning of any such link. That another website is linked to our site does not constitute endorsement from Free Press Action Fund of the owner of the other site, the content of its site or its products or services.

**Electronic Mailing List Policies**

Free Press Action Fund offers several electronic mailing lists. If you choose to subscribe to any of these lists, we may ask for personal information such as your name, ZIP code and email address. We use this information solely to manage our lists (for example, we may use your ZIP code for a targeted mailing on an issue affecting your area). We do not sell, rent or share any information from our electronic mailing lists.

There are a number of ways to subscribe to Free Press Action Fund's electronic mailing lists, including submitting a form on our website, opting in when you engage in online or offline activism, or mailing or completing a sign-up form from a paper petition, brochure or flier. When you subscribe, you will typically receive a confirmation message welcoming you.

You may unsubscribe from any of our lists at any time. If you wish to update your information, delete or otherwise make changes to your relationship with us, or remove yourself entirely from our list(s), [click here](http://act.freepress.net/unsubscribe/unsubscribe_fpaf/).

Lists Free Press Action Fund maintains for electronic mailings are exclusively “opt-in” lists. We do not purchase information from third-party sources or gather personal data from the Web (known as spidering) for inclusion in our email lists.

**Online Activism**

Our website offers many ways to engage in online activism. Many of these tools are hosted and administered by a third party (currently ActionKit). When you provide personal information by signing a petition or engaging in other actions, that personal information may be stored on our server(s) and/or ActionKit’s server(s). If you choose to join a mailing list or become a member at the same time that you participate in an online action, your relevant information will be kept and used for those other purposes.

We may deliver petitions and surveys you’ve completed to the U.S. president, federal and state legislators, agencies like the Federal Communications Commission, other elected and appointed officials, or other entities such as companies whose policies we seek to change. We ask for your address so we can deliver your message to the appropriate legislative offices, and may include information such as your name, town or city and state in these deliveries.

ActionKit strictly adheres to policies preventing unauthorized access to your personal information and will not make such information available to anyone outside of Free Press Action Fund or ActionKit (unless legally compelled to do so).

**Financial Support**

Free Press Action Fund is committed to maintaining the trust and security of all financial supporters. We collect personal information including the email and mailing addresses that members and donors provide. We might use this information for online and print mailings to keep you informed about our programs and occasionally to ask for additional financial support. You may opt out of these communications at any time.

To opt out of email communication, [click here](http://act2.freepress.net/unsubscribe/unsubscribe_freepress/).

To opt out of print mailings, please call us at 413-585-1533 or email Rachel Courtney.

On occasion, Free Press Action Fund sends messages on behalf of other reputable organizations when we believe such messages may be of value to our members and supporters. Our ability to send you these messages on behalf of other entities helps us build our membership base and further the movement for your rights to connect and communicate. If you do not wish to receive such messages from our allied or aligned organizations, please call us at 413-585-1533 or email Rachel Courtney. Free Press Action Fund is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content produced or provided by any of these other entities.

All financial data is collected via a secure Web connection, and is stored or transmitted using appropriate security measures at all times.

**Online and Phone Orders for Materials**

Information provided to us in the course of placing an order for educational materials, activist toolkits, promotional materials or other materials offered by Free Press Action Fund (whether or not the materials are offered at a cost) may be retained for use in future communications, such as membership drives, or when we unveil similar offerings we believe may be of interest to you. This information will not be given, sold, rented, shared or otherwise provided to anyone else without your prior consent (except when compelled by law — see below).

All financial data is collected via a secure Web connection, and is stored or transmitted using appropriate security measures at all times.

**Compelled Disclosure**

If we are required by law to disclose any information that you have provided us, we will attempt to give you notice (unless we are prohibited from doing so) that a request for your information has been made, in order to give you an opportunity to object. We will attempt to provide this notice by email, if you have given us an email address, or by postal mail if you have entered a postal address. If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information. In addition, we may independently object to any disclosures we believe to be improper.
