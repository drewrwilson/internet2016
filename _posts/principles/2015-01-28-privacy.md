Online privacy is under constant assault from a federal, state and local surveillance apparatus that is too often justified in the name of national security. In recent decades, and especially since the Sept. 11 attacks, Congress has passed legislation that gives broad discretion to the NSA, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and others to surveil and collect the private online communications of people in the United States and abroad. Intelligence officials have also misinterpreted the law in ways that threaten our most fundamental constitutional rights, including our rights to free expression, assembly, due process and privacy.

The NSA and other intelligence agencies often collaborate with Internet and telecommunications companies that store personal data from hundreds of millions of people. Once companies share this information with government entities, it can be used and abused in ways that threaten the basic rights of innocent people. History has showed that federal, state and local authorities disproportionately use such data to target and intimidate communities of color and political activists. The rules that govern access to digital data are often created without any transparency, oversight or accountability.

We need to restore the balance between civil liberties and national security. This means amending or “sunsetting” many of the laws passed in the wake of Sept. 11. We also need a full review of all national security legislation, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Espionage Act, that authorities have misinterpreted and used to spy on our online communications and violate our privacy. Other policy recommendations:

 1. Amend legislation like the Patriot Act and the FISA Amendments Act to protect our constitutional rights and promote transparency and accountability.

 1. Oppose so-called cybersecurity legislation that indemnifies Internet companies and social media networks for violating privacy policies and turning over troves of sensitive personal data to government authorities.

 1. Update the Electronic Communications Privacy Act to prevent law enforcement agencies from accessing online communications without a warrant.

 1. Support an independent congressional investigation — similar to the Church Committee — into the federal government’s intelligence-gathering practices.

 1. Advocate for changes to the federal government’s guidance for law enforcement agencies on the use of race, gender, religion, ethnicity, and other classifications.

 1. Oppose legal limits to encryption systems that make them vulnerable to backdoor hacks and other incursions by government authorities.
