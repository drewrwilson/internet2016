The First Amendment is the foundation of a healthy democracy. It bars Congress from making laws that prohibit freedom of speech, the press, assembly and religion, and protects our right to petition government. The Constitution recognizes that an open exchange of ideas is essential to our survival as a democratic society. That’s a value that survives to this day.

Yet the framers of the Constitution could not have foreseen a time in which technology allowed more than 200 million people in the U.S. to communicate via interconnected digital platforms. Nor could they have envisioned a world in which companies like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon wield more authority over this free speech than a British monarch.

The sheer scale of free speech today is without precedent in human history. Millions are finding their voices via the Internet. But too often the companies that control the platforms and networks we need to connect and communicate restrict or outright violate our free speech rights. Governments have also sought to control the flow of information and silence whistleblowers who use the Internet to expose harmful and illegal government activities.

The open Internet by design resists government and corporate efforts to interfere with our communications. Our political leadership must support policies that protect this openness and guard against censorship in its many forms.

 1. Support classifying Internet access providers as common carriers so they can’t block, throttle or in any way discriminate against the legal online communications of Internet users (more under “Openness” below).  

 1. Oppose any legislation that sacrifices our rights (including our rights to assemble and speak freely online) in the name of national security.  

 1. Defend everyone’s “right to record” by opposing policies that make it illegal for people to photograph or record official activity when it takes place in public.

 1. Reject the dubious legal argument that the First Amendment grants Internet service providers the right to “edit” or censor Internet content as it crosses their networks.
