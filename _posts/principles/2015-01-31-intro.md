In the United States, tens of millions of people have already demonstrated their support for public interest-driven Internet policies and their opposition to legislation that threatens our online rights. A growing community of advocates and activists worked together to defeat the PIPA and SOPA Web censorship legislation in 2012. We’ve formed a deep grassroots coalition to oppose mass surveillance of our communications. And most recently, we’ve mobilized to secure strong Net Neutrality rules and oppose cable industry mergers. 

No other communications medium in history has had such vast potential to help drive social change and improve the lives of so many so quickly. And yet the benefits of the Internet have not been evenly distributed. We need to ensure that the Internet serves the public — and doesn’t harm communities by furthering inequality or discrimination. To do this, our communications policies must be rooted in the principles of free speech, access, privacy, choice and openness.  

Internet users form a vast and powerful constituency that’s been working together for more than a decade to protect our rights. In 2016 we’re ready to vote with our values. **The policy platform outlined below reflects the principles and priorities of millions of Internet voters.**
