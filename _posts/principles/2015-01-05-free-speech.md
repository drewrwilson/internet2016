The First Amendment is the foundation of a healthy democracy in the United States. The Constitution recognizes that an open exchange of ideas is essential to our survival as a democratic society. That’s a value that seems even more relevant at a time when more than 200 million people in the United States are not only reading, watching and listening to the media, but creating new content and communicating their own ideas via interconnected digital platforms.

The sheer scale of free speech today is without precedent in history. But too often the companies that control the platforms and networks we use to communicate restrict or outright block our ability to speak freely.<sup>[3](#3)</sup> At various points in history, governments around the world have sought to control the flow of information, to silence and discriminate against protesters, and to prosecute whistleblowers — who today use the Internet to expose harmful and illegal activities by authorities.

The architecture of the open Internet by design resists government and corporate efforts to interfere with our rights to connect and communicate. Our elected leaders must remain vigilant, however, and support policies that protect this openness and guard against censorship in its many forms.

 * Oppose any legislation that sacrifices our rights (including freedom of the press, our rights to assemble, petition government, and speak freely online) in the name of national security.  

 * Pursue balanced copyright law with the strongest possible protections for freedom of expression and the platforms where that expression happens; oppose efforts to force Internet intermediaries to monitor or police their users.<sup>[4](#4)</sup>

 * Defend everyone’s “right to record” by opposing policies that make it illegal for people to photograph or record official activity when it takes place in public.<sup>[5](#5)</sup>

 * Support classifying Internet access providers as common carriers so they can’t block, throttle or discriminate against the communications of Internet users.
