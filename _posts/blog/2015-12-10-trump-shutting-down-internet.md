Every day something hateful comes out of Donald Trump's mouth. 

He wants to keep Muslims from entering the country. He wants to throw out immigrants. He cheers as angry crowds assault protesters. As *[The New York Times]*(http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/12/07/donald-trump-calls-for-banning-muslims-from-entering-u-s/)</em> noted, his language is "more typically associated with racist hate groups." According to [TIME](http://time.com/4140050/donald-trump-muslims-japanese-internment/), he's not sure if he would have supported the racist internment of more than 100,000 Japanese Americans during World War II â€” for which our government has apologized and paid reparations. 

Trump also has no respect for freedom of the press. He regularly removes journalists from campaign events. When members of the media are present, his team prevents them from leaving pens designed to contain them physically and constrain their reporting. 

Now you can add the free and open Internet to Trump's list of targets. After the recent terrorist attack in San Bernardino he said we should "[close the Internet up in some way](http://mic.com/articles/129938/donald-trump-wants-to-close-up-the-internet-because-he-doesn-t-understand-the-internet#.UmFspDfrV)." Locking down the Internet is not the way forward for the United States. The open Internet is one of the most effective ways to combat hate speech and give communities a voice. 

Trump's made a lot of despicable comments that people need to forcefully and loudly oppose. And if you care about Internet freedom, this is the moment to speak out. 

Trump isn't the only one talking about limiting our rights to connect and communicate. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has spoken of shutting "[off the means of communication](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151207/21225233018/two-leading-presidential-candidates-clinton-trump-both-mocked-free-speech-internet.shtml)" for terrorist groups and has dismissed concerns over how that would impact freedom of speech for everything else online. We need to confront terrorism, but you can't shut down one part of the Internet without harming the rest of it.

Shutting down our borders, calling for state-sanctioned programs designed to oppress certain racial groups and religions, closing up the Internet and curtailing free speech are not the right ways to respond to tragic terrorist attacks. If Trump's ideas become policy everyone's fundamental rights and freedoms will be in jeopardy. Communities of color and other historically marginalized communities will be most at risk. 

Using the Internet as a tool of oppression won't make us safer. It will harm people of color who are regularly targeted by technologies used to profile, imprison and punish entire communities. It will harm our democracy. 

We need to use the Internet as a tool of liberation to counter hate speech, challenge the candidates in a way the mainstream corporate media don't, and encourage more speech (not less.) 

Right now 17 candidates are racing toward the White House. Trump and Clinton are setting the pace, and if their ideas about free speech online become policy everyone's fundamental rights and freedoms will be in danger. We need to know where all the candidates stand on this issue before it's too late. 

Tell Trump and all the other presidential contenders that **[shutting down the Internet is not the answer](http://act.freepress.net/sign/internet_2016_shut_down/?source=blog)**.

We won't tolerate restrictions on our rights to connect and communicate.
