On Monday, *TIME* photographer Christopher Morris was [thrown to the ground and choked](https://news.vice.com/article/secret-service-agents-allegedly-choke-slam-journalist-at-donald-trump-rally) by a member of the U.S. Secret Service as he attempted to document the removal of Black Lives Matter protesters from a Trump rally in Virginia. 

An agent “grabbed me by the neck and started choking me and slammed me to the ground,” said Morris. Several eyewitness videos confirm Morris’ account. He was escorted from the event and briefly detained.

The activists Morris was attempting to document were ejected from the rally at Radford University for chanting “No more hate! No more hate! Let’s be equal, let’s be great!” 

Later that same day, a group of about [30 Black students](http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid3700942850001?bckey=AQ~~,AAAABvaL8JE~,ufBHq_I6FnyEZUwdWYNYsWrjzDHq9v-S&bctid=4780439200001) were removed from a Trump rally at Valdosta State University in Georgia. The students forced out of the event had pre-registered to attend and sat silently as a group leading up to their removal.

Several weeks ago, Rose Hamid, a [Muslim woman who stood in silent protest](http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/08/politics/donald-trump-muslim-woman-protesting-ejected/) at a Trump rally in South Carolina, was removed and heckled by the crowd. “This demonstrates how when you start dehumanizing the other it can turn people into very hateful, ugly people,” Hamid said. “It needs to be known.” 

These incidents are part of a pattern for Trump events: The campaign has profiled and ejected people from multiple rallies because of their race or religious dress. This makes the role of the press all the more critical: We need reporters to be our eyes and ears at political events, to hold everyone involved — candidates, security, attendees — accountable for their actions.

And while the Trump campaign isn’t the only one attempting to contain reporters in pens at events, it’s the worst offender. It’s bad enough when the campaign itself restricts journalists in this way; it’s even worse when Secret Service officers or local law enforcement aid in this process. Secret Service agents [are supposed to](http://www.secretservice.gov/about/faqs/) protect candidates against threats, to “maintain the integrity of the democratic process and continuity of government.” Corralling journalists hardly qualifies as maintaining “the integrity of the democratic process.”

The Trump campaign has mistreated journalists throughout this election season. At a November rally in Worcester, Massachusetts, Trump’s campaign manager [threatened CNN’s Noah Gray](https://internet2016.net/blog/trump-rally-worcester.html) when he left the “media pen.” The campaign has repeatedly barred Univision reporters from events and had [anchor Jorge Ramos](https://internet2016.net/blog/univision-repeatedly-barred-trump-events.html) physically removed from an August press conference. After Fox News host Megyn Kelly asked Trump some tough questions at an August debate, he derided her using misogynist terms and [refused to attend](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/27/the-long-strange-history-of-the-donald-trump-megyn-kelly-feud/) a subsequent debate she co-moderated.

“It’s journalists’ job to push boundaries, investigate and challenge — that’s what the press is required to do in a democracy,” said my Free Press Action Fund colleague Mike Rispoli.

Media pens don’t make anyone safer. But they do make it difficult for journalists to document acts of racial profiling, harassment and conflict — and that makes everyone less safe.

If you’re concerned about the treatment of the press, tell the Secret Service to [stop abusing reporters and start respecting the First Amendment](http://act.freepress.net/sign/press_freedom_secret_service/?source=FPblog).
