In our increasingly digital age, the divide in Internet connectivity further marginalizes people of color and those of lower socioeconomic status. Not having access to high-speed Internet means not having access to certain opportunities — like applying for jobs and college, accessing financial aid, banking online and being able to fully participate in school or work. Those who *can* afford home Internet access pay much more than they should for a basic necessity.
 
We all need the Internet. This is why some of the presidential candidates are addressing lack of access as an infrastructure issue.
 
Last November, Secretary Hillary Clinton released an [infrastructure plan](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/11/30/clinton-infrastructure-plan-builds-tomorrows-economy-today/) that includes expanding affordable access to broadband. Should she be elected, Clinton says she will "finish the job of connecting America's households to the Internet, committing that by 2020, 100 percent of households in America will have access to affordable broadband that delivers world-class speeds … "
 
Sen. Bernie Sanders has released a [similar plan](https://berniesanders.com/issues/creating-jobs-rebuilding-america/), one that commits to investing "$5 billion a year to expand high-speed broadband networks in under-served and unserved areas." These plans reflect the importance that broadband and other tech issues will play in this election.
 
Voters who understand the significance of issues like Net Neutrality, mass government surveillance, encryption and the digital divide have been [bird-dogging candidates](https://internet2016.net/blog/bird-dogging-in-2015.html) and urging them to come out with forward-thinking Internet policy platforms. Voters deserve to know what the candidates have planned when it comes to our digital infrastructure. And these plans need to address the lack of competition in the broadband market.
 
Policymakers can't address the digital divide without addressing media consolidation. Like the proposed Comcast merger before it, the Charter-Time Warner Cable deal has the potential to exacerbate the digital divide, making it harder for everyone to get online and stay connected.
 
If this deal is approved, Charter would rival Comcast in size — and the merger would allow the two companies to offer service to nearly 80 percent of U.S. homes. Antitrust theory and history tell us that this would decrease competition, consolidate power over the Internet and potentially halt positive innovation in the video market. We've seen this before: Broadband providers behave in the same way railroad tycoons did in the early part of the 20th century.
 
And if the Charter deal goes through, the company would likely [raise monthly prices](http://www.freepress.net/stop-charter-time-warner-cable-merger) for broadband service to pay off merger-related debt. The deal would allow Charter to take over the New York City and Los Angeles markets, which would broaden the digital divide by concentrating market power in areas where many people are already struggling to afford broadband. We need the FCC to [block this deal](https://nomoremergers.com/?source=fpaction) — and we need whoever is elected president to commit to expanding affordable broadband access and to appointing FCC commissioners who will hold ISPs accountable to the public interest.
 
Presidential candidates Clinton, Sanders and [Carly Fiorina](https://internet2016.net/blog/iowa-bird-dogging-december-2015.html) have all stated that there needs to be more competition in the broadband market — but they haven't explained how their respective administrations would break up the broadband monopolies. If the candidates are serious about closing the digital divide and expanding affordable access to broadband, then they need to address the role that mega-mergers play. The candidates can begin by tackling the monopoly problem that exists within the broadband industry.
