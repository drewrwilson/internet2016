For more than a year, the Trump campaign has systematically tried to deny journalists access to press events and public rallies, restricting reporters to designated media “pens” and displaying hostility toward anyone daring to cover the candidate from a critical perspective.

Last August, security ejected [Univision’s Jorge Ramos](http://www.npr.org/2015/08/26/434975397/univision-anchor-jorge-ramos-removed-from-trump-press-conference) from a Trump press conference after he asked a question about Trump’s racist immigration policies. Six months later, the Secret Service “throat-slammed” [*TIME* photojournalist Christopher Morris](http://time.com/4241899/donald-trump-rally-time-photographer-chris-morris/), who tried to step out of the press pen to photograph a protester.

This week, *The Washington Post* — one of the nation’s most respected newspapers — joined the list of outlets [Trump has barred](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/business/media/trump-kicks-phony-and-dishonest-washington-post-off-his-campaign.html) from covering his events. Both the [Society of Professional Journalists](http://www.spj.org/news.asp?ref=1445) and the [Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press](http://www.rcfp.org/reporters-committee-chairman-troubled-trumps-stance-toward-journalists) issued statements condemning this trend.

Both of these statements address the essential role journalism plays in a democracy. “Journalists covering a political campaign perform an important public service,” said SPJ President Paul Fletcher. “They provide information to the American public seeking to determine our next leaders. Journalists must be free to do their jobs without fear of reprisal, intimidation and threat of physical harm.”

The Free Press Action Fund agrees that professional journalists need to be free to do their jobs, and we believe these same protections must be extended to people documenting important events even if they aren’t affiliated with a media outlet.

RCFP Chairman David Boardman, who also serves as dean of Temple University’s School of Media and Communication, expanded on Fletcher’s commentary, saying, “The responsibility of the press is to ask challenging questions of candidates and to fully explore their records, especially when those candidates are running for the most powerful position in the world.”

*Washington Post* Executive Editor Marty Baron, who won acclaim for spearheading the *Boston Globe*’s investigation into the Catholic Church’s cover-up of sexual abuse committed by priests, responded to the addition of his paper to Trump’s [blacklist](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-media-blacklist_us_575f5323e4b071ec19ef04ab). “Donald Trump’s decision to revoke the *Washington Post*’s press credentials is nothing less than a repudiation of the role of a free and independent press,” Baron wrote. “ ... When coverage doesn’t correspond to what the candidate wants it to be, then a news organization is banished.”

At this point in the campaign, Trump has revoked the press credentials for at least [11 news outlets](http://gawker.com/a-running-list-of-the-publications-and-reporters-who-ha-1781918257), including Buzzfeed, The Daily Beast, *The Des Moines Register*, Gawker, The Huffington Post, *Mother Jones*, *National Review* and *The New Tri-State Defender*. But these actions haven’t stopped journalists at these outlets from reporting on Trump. Some attend Trump events without credentials and work from the general admission section. Others don’t find it necessary to attend campaign events to write about Trump’s statements, policies and campaign strategies.

The blacklist, the [rough treatment](https://news.vice.com/article/why-its-no-surprise-a-journalist-got-choked-at-a-donald-trump-rally) of credentialed journalists and the recent interviews in which [CNN’s Jake Tapper](http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/06/03/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-judge-jake-tapper-full-interview-lead.cnn) and [CBS’ John Dickerson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHoXC4HX-Z8) pressed Trump to defend racist remarks are all fueling a debate about how American journalists do their jobs. [The Intercept’s Glenn Greenwald](http://www.ibtimes.com/death-view-nowhere-how-donald-trump-broke-medias-brain-2379767) and [NPR’s Bob Garfield](http://www.wnyc.org/story/on-the-media-2016-06-10/) have both called for reporters to abandon the objectivity that has long been their professional standard, arguing that it’s appropriate, even necessary, for journalists on the campaign trail to directly confront inaccuracies and demagoguery rather than relying on tactics like asking Trump to respond to Hillary Clinton’s statements.

Journalists, media critics and others are proposing various ways to challenge Trump. *The Washington Post*’s Dana Milbank has suggested a version of a [media blackout](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-right-response-to-donald-trump-a-media-blackout/2016/06/14/2868a0e0-3256-11e6-8758-d58e76e11b12_story.html) — “an end to the uncritical, free publicity” that’s fueled Trump’s campaign. NPR’s Bob Garfield notes that the press has been sleepwalking instead of fulfilling its true mission: “its function to preserve an orderly democracy.”

Ultimately a democracy is about people — and we need hard-hitting journalism that serves our communities. When it comes to Trump, that means confronting the racism, misogyny, Islamophobia and outright lies designed to divide and mislead us.
