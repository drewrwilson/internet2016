Last Friday Univision journalists were [kicked out of a Donald Trump rally](http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/donald-trump-univision-miami-rally-1201625471/) in Florida. This isn't the first time the Trump team has responded to the network in this way; Trump snubbed its Emmy-winning anchor Jorge Ramos during a news conference in August.

Writing about presidential frontrunners is of utmost importance at this point in the campaign cycle &mdash; and journalists shouldn't be kept from doing their jobs and reporting on issues of interest to their audiences. 

Using the power of the open Internet, Ramos [got the message out about last Friday's events via Twitter](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/donald-trump-kicks-univision-florida-834377): "Journalists from Univision were not allowed to cover a Donald Trump political event today in Doral, Florida."

Journalist Lourdes Del Rio wasn't granted press credentials to cover the event &mdash; and she and others from the Univision team were [denied access by police](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/23/donald-trumps-campaign-prevents-univision-news-crew-from-entering-miami-rally/) who "asked her and the Univision crew to leave because they were on private property and ... Trump didn't want them at his event."

Journalists are supposed to ask questions and report on the answers. They bring the candidates to everyday people &mdash; people who cast ballots based in part on the information they receive from media outlets. Journalism is not a crime, and reporters should not be met with police lines.

But Univision &mdash; the [biggest U.S. Spanish-language media company](http://www.journalism.org/2015/04/29/hispanic-media-fact-sheet/) &mdash; has been repeatedly sidelined in its efforts to cover Trump. 

The first ejection came on the heels of degrading remarks Mr. Trump made about undocumented Mexican immigrants during his campaign announcement speech; these comments prompted Univision to cancel its contract with the Trump-owned Miss Universe organization.

As National Hispanic Media Coalition President and CEO [Alex Nogales noted on CNN](http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2015/06/30/latino-mexican-hispanic-racism-trump-comments-gop-alex-nogales-don-lemon-cnn-tonight.cnn), Trump's statements are based on a racist narrative Ã‘ and we need to know where he and the other candidates stand on issues that matter to Latinos. But when Ramos asked Trump about his immigration policies at the August campaign event, he was [ignored, shouted at and removed by security](https://theintercept.com/2015/08/26/jorge-ramos-commits-journalism-gets-immediately-attacked-journalists/). 

Given that people of color are Univision's primary audience &mdash; and given that Trump has made a series of racist and inflammatory statements about immigrants and immigration policy &mdash; the network's reporters need to be able to cover his events. 

As long as politicians are out on the campaign trail, journalists like Ramos and Del Rio will be there too. It's essential that candidates stop excluding journalists from any public events.
