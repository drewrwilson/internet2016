The Free Press Action Fund doesn’t support or oppose any candidate for public office. We do oppose racism.

That’s why we joined a campaign led by our close allies at ColorOfChange that urges major corporations not to sponsor or otherwise support the Republican National Convention if Donald Trump is the GOP nominee.

You may have recently gotten an email from us asking Google to pull its funding and support from a Trump-led RNC, and we <a href='https://twitter.com/wearevsgoliath/status/725749214181912576' target='_blank'>joined</a> a bunch of other groups to deliver more than 500,000 petitions to the company’s headquarters last week. We’ve also pressured Microsoft, which just <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/04/29/microsoft-will-not-donate-money-to-republicans-convention/' target='_blank'>announced</a> that it won’t give money to the convention.

We don’t want to tell you whom to vote for — and we have a long track record of criticizing both Democrats and Republicans who threaten Internet and press freedom. But as a group committed to free expression, democracy and race equity, we will speak out against hate speech, misogyny and xenophobia.

We think major tech and media companies should be denouncing — not bankrolling — Trump’s attacks on women and people of color. Thousands and thousands of Free Press Action Fund members have already joined in this campaign — and <a href='http://act.freepress.net/sign/internet_2016_rnc?source=FPblog' target='_blank'>we hope you’ll add your voice</a>.

We’ve gotten a few questions from our members about this work. Below are some answers.

<strong>How can you say you don’t support or oppose candidates for public office after sending me an email about Donald Trump?</strong>

The Free Press Action Fund is a 501(c)(4) organization, but we don’t work for the election or defeat of any candidates. However, we do pay close attention to what they’re doing or saying about Internet freedom and press freedom. We critique Democrats and Republicans alike based on their positions on the issues.

We’re following all of the major-party candidates as part of our Internet 2016 campaign. Check out our blog and Internet policy platform for info on our activities and policy priorities and read our 2016 Internet Voter Guide to see where the candidates stand on issues like privacy and the steep cost of Internet access.

As Rashad Robinson of ColorOfChange has said, this campaign “isn’t about left or right, but about right and wrong.” We stand with our allies in denouncing Donald Trump’s violent rhetoric targeting people of color, immigrants, refugees, Muslims and women. And we’re calling on companies like Google, Microsoft and AT&T to demonstrate that they don’t condone racism and misogyny.

<strong>How does this campaign fit with the Free Press Action Fund’s mission?</strong>

The Free Press Action Fund fights for your rights to connect and communicate. We seek to create a world where people have the information and opportunities they need to tell their own stories, hold leaders accountable, and participate in our democracy. This campaign involves the industries we monitor and relates to the media, technology and democracy issues we care about most.
At the Free Press Action Fund, we’re also committed to advancing racial equity and supporting our allies in the fight for racial justice. As I wrote last summer in a Free Press blog <a href='http://www.freepress.net/blog/2015/08/14/we-stand-blacklivesmatter' target='_blank'>explaining</a> our support for the Movement for Black Lives, “Every issue Free Press works on — Net Neutrality, media ownership, the future of journalism, even spectrum policy — intersects with the legacy and the reality of structural racism. To create a better media system and a more just society, the pursuit of racial equity must be a top priority.”

<strong>Why are you trying to censor Trump?</strong>

We aren’t doing anything of the kind. He’s free to spout whatever hateful nonsense he wants.

And we expect journalists to cover his campaign. Reporters should ask tough questions, check the facts and evaluate the policies of all the candidates.

But the communications companies that provide access to or thrive on the Internet — an Internet Trump has <a href='http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/12/08/dear-donald-trump-only-despots-close-up-the-internet.html' target='_blank'>threatened to shut down</a> — shouldn’t finance his political coronation. Instead, they should take a stand against Trump’s demagoguery by dropping their sponsorship of this year’s RNC.

Trump and the other candidates can say whatever they’d like — and so can we. And we refuse to stay silent about Trump’s racism.

<strong>What evidence do you have that Trump is racist?</strong>

Trump has made so many racist, sexist and xenophobic statements — far too many to list here. He’s also advocated violence against his critics, protesters and the press.

As strong supporters of the free and open Internet, we encourage you to use it to learn more. If you need help, <a href='http://lmgtfy.com/?q=racist+statements+by+donald+trump' target='_blank'>here’s a good place to start</a>.
