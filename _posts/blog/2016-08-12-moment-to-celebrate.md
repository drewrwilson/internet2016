In the months leading up to the Republican National Convention, Free Press Action Fund members urged technology companies to refuse to support a Trump-led RNC.

Multiple factors — including a disproportionate amount of uncritical media coverage — have contributed to the rise of a modern-day demagogue. Way too many media outlets have been happy to profit off of Trump’s hate.

Our activists joined hundreds of thousands of people who took action through ColorOfChange PAC, which led the Divest from Hate campaign against racism and violent rhetoric targeting people of color.

And all of these voices were heard — 15 major companies, including Apple, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, [reduced their degree of support or outright refused](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/21/inside-the-trump-convention-divestment-movement/) to give a penny to the convention.

As a result, the event suffered a multimillion-dollar budget shortfall, and an [RNC letter](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/rnc-begs-adelson-for-6-million-to-cover-convention-shortfall-225571) about the budget highlights the direct connection between the fundraising gap and the pressure people helped put on corporate donors: “Over the past couple months, negative publicity around our potential nominee resulted in a considerable number of pledges backing out from their commitments.”

This is huge — and it’s a moment to celebrate.

The collective pressure of activists from organizations like ColorOfChange PAC, Bend the Arc, the Center for Media Justice, Courage Campaign, CREDO Action, the Free Press Action Fund, Muslim Advocates, UltraViolet and many others shows that when we work together we can accomplish big things that chip away at racism, sexism and other forms of hatred.

So take a moment to celebrate this victory. Then stay with us as we continue to fight flaws in our media system, including a bottom-line mentality that prioritizes profits over people; the concentration of power in the hands of a few powerful white men; offensive or insufficient coverage of marginalized communities; lack of racial and gender diversity in all forms of media at every level ... the list goes on. We will continue to critique these problems and seek solutions. 

For far too long corporate media outlets have been willing partners in a system designed to harm people of color and other historically marginalized groups while maintaining white male supremacy. The media need to pay attention to the national crisis around race and the direct impact it has on people’s lives.

We’re committed to advancing racial equity and supporting our allies in the fight for media and racial justice. And with Free Press Action Fund members and allies by our side, we’ll continue to demand change.
