Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders hailed Tuesday’s federal appeals court decision upholding the FCC’s Net Neutrality rules:

So far we haven’t heard from Donald Trump — and it’s not clear what (if anything) he’ll say about the court decision. In the past he’s [claimed](https://internet2016.net/voter-guide/) that Net Neutrality protections represent an “attack on the internet that would ‘target conservative media.’” Net Neutrality rules do nothing of the kind. 

Net Neutrality is about maintaining a space where anyone — including media that span the political spectrum — can do and say whatever they want without interference from corporations or the government. 

Trump’s statement shows that he doesn’t know what Net Neutrality is or how it works — so we must stay vigilant and push back against misinformation and misguided attempts to shut down the open internet. 

For more than 10 years people across the country have been signing petitions, making phone calls, organizing actions in the streets and fighting Comcast, Verizon and AT&T on multiple fronts to protect the open internet. Millions of people have worked this hard because we know the open internet is critical to our work for justice and the policies our communities need. 

The internet helps us stay in touch with each other, the world around us and our political leaders. It’s crucial to our economic growth, our education and so much more. It’s an essential tool organizers and activists use to make our communities a better place. 

And now that we know Net Neutrality will remain the law of the land we’ll keep using the internet to fight back against corporations like Comcast, Verizon and AT&T that want to lock down the network and use it to build their power against everyday people. 

It’s up to us to ensure the major-party candidates support an open, secure and affordable internet and to hold them accountable if they try to trample on our rights to connect and communicate. And when they do the right thing as Clinton and Sanders did yesterday we’ll note that and be sure to hold them to their word.
