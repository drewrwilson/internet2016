I've been traveling around Iowa bird-dogging candidates on Internet freedom issues, especially the need to protect our Fourth Amendment right to privacy. Here's what I learned on my most recent trip:

**Gov. Chris Christie**
At a small meet-and-greet in a Jefferson café, Christie spent most of his time taking questions from the audience. I asked how, if backdoors to encryption are part of his national security plan, he would protect our data from criminal hackers. Christie acknowledged that it's very difficult to balance surveillance needs with our right to privacy and said that "[we have to continue to improve our technology](https://www.facebook.com/internet2016/videos/vb.1411698009155892/1533336083658750/)."

As he talked further, it became clear that Christie is more inclined to protect national surveillance infrastructure than the Fourth Amendment. "I do think that the absolutist position that says ‘no access, no backdoor, keep everything totally encrypted,' the danger we run there is the loss of life," he said. "The danger to the backdoor is still a danger, but it's less. So I think we're picking among bad choices."

**Dr. Ben Carson**
Carson briefly addressed surveillance concerns at a veterans and military town hall in Waterloo. The moderator asked Carson if he thought implementation of the [USA Freedom Act](http://www.freepress.net/blog/2015/06/03/usa-freedom-act-passed-now-what), which changes the way the government can access phone metadata, should be delayed. Carson said that he "[might not be too upset about delaying the change](https://www.facebook.com/internet2016/videos/1533344723657886/)." Carson went on to say that "we need to make sure that we have in place something that allows us the access we need to potential terrorists but doesn't compromise the Fourth Amendment rights of our citizens."

**Gov. Martin O'Malley**
Following his segment of the Iowa Presidential Tech Town Hall, I had the opportunity to ask O'Malley two questions about improving broadband access. I chased him out of the town hall to make this [audio recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0awpSyb1ZZDdlNBR0oxRWN1VHc/view) of the governor saying that he would build on programs introduced as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to expand broadband access in low-income communities. Later, at a cocktail reception, I asked O'Malley how he would [promote competition in broadband markets](https://www.facebook.com/internet2016/videos/1533346320324393/). He told me that one of his "15 strategic goals is restoring guidance to antitrust enforcement of fair competition … I do believe that we need to restore fair competition in our economy; there's never been an example where monopoly leads to good things for consumers."

**Carly Fiorina**
Fiorina also participated in the Iowa Presidential Tech Town Hall. While I wasn't able to ask her any questions, her speech focused on cybersecurity. She didn't explicitly state whether she would require encryption backdoors but argued that her time at Hewlett Packard prepared her to lead national cybersecurity efforts. At the very end of her time on stage, one of the town-hall panelists asked Fiorina how she would ensure that there's competition in the broadband market. Fiorina had only 30 seconds to respond but acknowledged that a [lack of competition is problematic](https://www.facebook.com/internet2016/videos/1533347876990904/).

Help us find out how all of the candidates would respect the principles of free speech, access, privacy, choice and openness online: Join us in [asking presidential candidates questions about Internet freedom](https://internet2016.net/toolkits/educate-the-candidates.html).

All of us can play a part in pushing all of the candidates to communicate real visions for the future of the Internet. If you live in Iowa and would like to get involved in the Internet 2016 campaign, [send me](mailto:kfuchs@freepress.net) an email.
