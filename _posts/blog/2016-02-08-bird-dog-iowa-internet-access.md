Only [67 percent of U.S. adults](http://www.freepress.net/blog/2015/12/22/pew-study-reveals-true-cost-pricey-internet-access) subscribe to broadband at home — and that number is even lower among rural residents, low-income communities and people of color. The high cost of high-speed Internet access is the main hurdle here — which is why I spent my last trip to Iowa asking four presidential candidates about how they would make broadband more affordable.

**Hillary Clinton**

In October, Secretary Clinton [published an Op-Ed in Quartz](http://qz.com/529303/hillary-clinton-being-pro-business-doesnt-mean-hanging-consumers-out-to-dry/) calling for more competition among broadband providers. I couldn’t wait to get more details about Clinton’s plan, so I showed up to Miller Middle School in Marshalltown an hour before the doors were scheduled to open for her town-hall meeting. 

After her prepared remarks, I squeezed through the crowd to grab Clinton’s hand and asked her for more details about her plan to encourage competition and bring the cost of broadband down.

Her [detailed response](http://qz.com/529303/hillary-clinton-being-pro-business-doesnt-mean-hanging-consumers-out-to-dry/) surprised me. Clinton didn’t repeat her call for competition, instead noting that countries like South Korea have much faster networks and saying that the government should subsidize the cost of broadband for low-income Americans. Clinton also mentioned that we’ve had successful large-scale infrastructure projects before, citing the 20th-century effort to bring electricity to all corners of the country.

**Bernie Sanders**

The following day I drove from Marshalltown to Mason City to try to get Sen. Sanders on record about making broadband more affordable. With the previous night’s lessons still fresh in my mind, I showed up early and got a seat in the front row.

I was disappointed that Sanders didn’t take any questions from the stage, but I moved forward to shake his hand after his speech as he headed for the door. Unfortunately, Sanders couldn’t hear me over the loud music in the hall and asked me to repeat myself. As I was shouting my question a second time security was moving Sanders toward the exit, limiting his response to “Broadband?” and a thumbs up — not exactly an airtight policy statement.

I raced out of the venue to the Sanders campaign bus to try to ask my question a third time, missing him by seconds. 

**Chris Christie**

Later in the week, I attended a Christie town-hall meeting at Central Community College in Pella. I nabbed a seat next to Gov. Christie’s wife Mary Pat and let out an audible sigh of relief when he said that most of the event would be dedicated to Q&A time.

I asked Christie what he would do to increase competition in the broadband market and get more low-income and rural residents connected. He saidhe would [include the Internet as one of the four planks of his infrastructure plan](https://www.facebook.com/internet2016/videos/vb.1411698009155892/1557883757870649/?type=2&theater), along with repairing roads and bridges and modernizing the electrical grid. Christie went into detail about how he would change the tax code to fund his infrastructure plan but had little to say about how he would make broadband more affordable and accessible.

**Marco Rubio**

Next I drove three hours to hear Sen. Rubio speak in the town of Clinton (yes, Clinton). I managed to grab a seat in the front row but wasn’t called on during the ensuing Q&A.

I hurried to the front of the handshake line, where I got a chance to ask my question. Building on the work of [other Free Press Action Fund bird-dogs](https://internet2016.net/blog/bird-dog-rubio-fiorina-cruz-sanders-nh.html), I asked Rubio what he would do to get more low-income people connected. Rubio talked about the Wi-Fi Innovation Act, which he’s co-sponsoring with Sen. Cory Booker. It was good to hear Rubio talk not only about opening up new spectrum for uses like Wi-Fi, but also about [reserving some spectrum](https://www.facebook.com/internet2016/videos/vb.1411698009155892/1557882547870770/?type=2&theater) for smaller wireless carriers.

However, while his ideas for wireless are generally encouraging, Rubio didn’t offer any ideas about how he would make high-speed wired broadband in the home more affordable. As important as mobile Internet access is for everyone, it’s still harder and more expensive without home broadband for kids to do their schoolwork and for parents to seek work or start businesses online.

I can’t wait to follow up with all of the candidates. Later this week I’ll deploy to New Hampshire with other Free Press Action Fund staffers and will keep prodding candidates to develop their positions on important Internet issues.
