A human-sized Internet Cat greeted about 1,000 Wisconsinites in the run-up to the state’s recent primary. 

Internet Cat has always wanted to achieve online fame. This is why she’s working with the Free Press Action Fund to protect the Internet by pushing all of the presidential candidates to stand up for free speech, access, privacy, choice and openness online.

At a town hall for Sen. Bernie Sanders in Sheboygan, Internet Cat talked with attendees and handed out #InternetVoter stickers that read “I <3 the Internet + I Vote.” About 30 attendees at the town hall showed their love for the Internet by taking photos with Internet Cat, and an overwhelming majority of the folks she spoke with identified as #InternetVoters by the end of these conversations.

It’s clear that Internet freedom issues transcend the partisan divide. Folks attending Sen. Ted Cruz’s town hall in Madison also gave Internet Cat a warm reception. About 300 people took Internet 2016 stickers and spoke with our feline friend. Most of these attendees agreed that increasing competition among broadband providers and connecting more Americans at affordable rates are important issues for candidates to address.

This issue has been a dominant one throughout the Internet 2016 campaign. People we’ve talked to in Iowa, New Hampshire and other states agree that the cost of broadband is way too high. Voters want presidential candidates from all parties to develop plans to make high-speed Internet access more affordable for everyone.

We’re going to keep hitting the campaign trail in the months ahead. Follow the Internet 2016 campaign on Twitter @freepressaction for updates.
