Sen. Bernie Sanders made a stop at UMass Amherst last Monday to rally support in the runup to Super Tuesday. The Internet 2016 team was there to show our love for the Internet and to see what Sanders had to say about his plans to protect our rights to connect and communicate. 

An estimated [9,000 people](http://dailycollegian.com/2016/02/23/bernie-sanders-speaks-to-9000-about-taking-on-american-political-establishment-at-mullins-center/) showed up, many of them students, to listen to the senator discuss his policy priorities. People we spoke with outside the venue were overwhelmingly in favor of curbing government surveillance, protecting Net Neutrality and making the Internet affordable for everyone — three of the touchstones of the Internet 2016 campaign.

“The Internet is power, and it needs to be kept free and equal for all people to access, not just for corporate interests,” said one woman, who noted that her background in information technology made this an important issue for her this election season.

Sanders didn’t touch on the Internet during his UMass speech, though his time in the Senate has given a sense of where he stands. Sanders has been a staunch [Net Neutrality advocate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPPipSJ4tGY) and has said he would [end mass NSA surveillance](http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/256865-sanders-would-absolutely-end-nsa-spying). Last year the senator voted [against](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&session=1&vote=00291) the disastrous bill CISA, which allows companies to surveil our communications and share their findings with the government. Last week he and four other Democratic senators [wrote a letter](http://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2016-02-25-TWC-Charter-Letter.pdf) to the FCC and Justice Department that expressed serious concerns about the Charter-Time Warner Cable merger, which would crush competition, raise prices and hurt low-income communities of color.

Here are a few statements Sanders has made in recent years:

“Our free and open Internet has made invaluable contributions to democracy both here in the United States and around the world. Whether you are rich, poor, young or old, the Internet allows all people to seek out information and communicate globally. We must not turn over our democracy to the highest bidder.” (April 24, 2014 [press release](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-statement-on-net-neutrality))

“The United States should not be accumulating phone records on tens of millions of innocent Americans. That is not what democracy is about.”  (June 6, 2013 [press release](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-slams-secret-surveillance)) 

“Americans deserve affordable access to the Internet, not hidden fees and rising prices.” (Feb. 6, 2016 [tweet](https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/696044968427655168/photo/1) from the Sanders campaign)

Like his Democratic rival [Secretary Hillary Clinton](http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/1/9826962/hillary-clinton-infrastructure-internet-plan), Sanders recognizes the need to invest in broadband and high-speed Internet services to bridge the digital divide. The Sanders plan promotes investing $25 billion over five years to expand high-speed broadband networks in unserved and underserved areas, and would boost speed and capacity all over the country. “High-speed Internet access is no longer a luxury,” the [plan](https://berniesanders.com/issues/improving-the-rural-economy/) states. “It is essential for 21st-century commerce, education, telemedicine, and public safety. And, it’s especially important for rural America to stay connected and to do business with the rest of the world.”

Free speech, access, choice, privacy and openness are at the core of the Internet 2016 campaign — and these issues are in the spotlight like never before. The question remains: Will the next president protect or trample our rights to connect and communicate?

It isn’t a hypothetical question given how some presidential contenders have [railed against Net Neutrality](https://internet2016.net/blog/candidates-lies-internet.html), advocated for [shutting down the Internet](https://internet2016.net/blog/trump-shutting-down-internet.html), and called for [permanently extending](https://internet2016.net/blog/surveillance-bird-dog-rubio.html) domestic spying programs.

As the race rolls on we’ll keep pushing **all** the candidates to stand up for our digital rights. Stay tuned.
