The Internet 2016 campaign was at Sen. Marco Rubio's town hall in Nashua, N.H., last Wednesday. We were there to ask him how he plans to get more people online and lower the sky-high cost of broadband. 

Rubio has hailed Internet companies like Airbnb, Amazon and Uber &mdash; and during the town hall he talked about the importance of online learning. But many people [don't have Internet access](https://medium.com/backchannel/battle-cry-of-new-hampshire-no-fiber-no-votes-fc5f2df34f68) in New Hampshire, which makes it hard for them to take advantage of everything the Internet has to offer.

When talking with Rubio we pointed out this conundrum and asked him how he would address it. 

In his response Rubio acknowledged the problem &mdash; and he mentioned "moms in his home state that line up at McDonald's in Miami just to get Wi-Fi." He also mentioned the expense of broadband &mdash; but he didn't say what he'd do to get more people online at affordable prices. What he did say is that he wants to open up more spectrum and "get it out of the government's hands." 

Putting spectrum to better use is important. It's especially useful if it goes to Wi-Fi, and other shared and free uses that lower barriers for people accessing the Internet. Given the extent of our nation's digital divide, however, we need more answers than that. And we need more serious discussions about lowering the price of broadband, which is the primary barrier to getting online in the U.S.

[Right now](http://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/resources/Free_Press_8-31-2015_Lifeline%20Comments_final.pdf) "94 percent of households with annual incomes above $100,000 have home high-speed Internet, versus 46 percent of those with annual household incomes below $20,000." And there's variation in the kinds of services people can afford: A family on a budget may be able to afford only modern day dial-up (aka DSL) or others may access the Internet exclusively via smartphones.

There is also a [racial and ethnic broadband divide](http://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/resources/Free_Press_8-31-2015_Lifeline%20Comments_final.pdf). In 2013, "82 percent of non-Hispanic whites lived in a household with home high-speed Internet access, compared to only 66 percent of Hispanic and black Americans and 59 percent of American Indian/Alaskan Natives."

The Internet is a lifeline. People access economic, educational, civic, political and social opportunities online &mdash; and they are free to share their voices as long as gatekeepers don't stand in the way.

But gaps across income and race have stranded many communities &mdash; in particular, those made up of  lower-income people of color &mdash; on the wrong side of the digital divide. This is particularly problematic because it deepens the division in our country between the "haves" and "have-nots" &mdash; the people who can access and make use of all of those opportunities, and those who simply can't. Meanwhile companies like Comcast and Charter want to raise our already high prices  Ã‘ which would further broaden and deepen the digital divide, all in the name of increasing the enormous profits these companies already reap.
  
It doesn't have to be this way. 

The high cost of broadband can be traced to government decisions that have allowed companies like Comcast to have unprecedented control over the telecommunications market. In fact, these companies have so much control that they're able to set monopoly-level prices. On broadband, the largest ISPs see [60 percent](http://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/resources/Free_Press_8-31-2015_Lifeline%20Comments_final.pdf) operating margins, while companies in other industries would be happy with 15 percent profit margins. 

In other words, there is so little competition for Big Cable that any price goes. Many customers have only one Internet access provider in their communities, so they have to pay whatever that company asks. And when rate hikes happen, people have no choice but to pay more. 

If this weren't bad enough, companies like Comcast are now [imposing data caps](http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Comcast-Dramatically-Expanding-Usage-Cap-Areas-December-1-135551) so they can tell customers how much Internet they can use each month, and charge them more if they use "too much." There's no reason for such caps. There's really no added cost to Comcast from increased usage over the course of a whole month. This is another one of those charges that the company imposes just because it can. These punitive practices will inevitably harm the same people already making hard choices between paying for Internet access and other necessities.

Despite the Internet's importance, politicians aren't talking enough about the need to make broadband affordable. We need more candidates to acknowledge that the high cost of broadband is a problem &mdash; and we need them to tell us what they'll do about it. 

Hillary Clinton [has acknowledged](http://qz.com/529303/hillary-clinton-being-pro-business-doesnt-mean-hanging-consumers-out-to-dry/) the monopoly control big companies have over broadband service. Bernie Sanders [called on the FCC](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/071015fccletter/?inline=file) to address the "ever-increasing rates for cable and Internet services." And Marco Rubio gave the issue a nod last week. 

To move toward affordable Internet access for everyone, we need <em>all</em> of the presidential candidates to talk about this issue. They need to stand up for the public interest instead of siding with greedy corporations.

Candidates can start by acknowledging the problem. And then they can tell us how they'll fix it.
