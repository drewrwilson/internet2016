Hours after the tragic terrorist attacks in Brussels, Sen. Ted Cruz [called for](http://m.motherjones.com/mojo/2016/03/ted-cruz-calls-patroling-muslim-neighborhoods) the targeted surveillance of U.S. “Muslim neighborhoods.”

He said he wants law enforcement to “patrol and secure” the streets where law-abiding Americans live. 

It’s not clear what Cruz means by such sweeping statements. But they threaten both our civil liberties and our security. And his position is just the most recent example of how politicians exploit crises to justify surveillance. 

Cruz himself [said so](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/10/ted-cruz-nsa-surveillance-san-bernardino) just a few months ago. He noted that unwarranted data collection didn’t stop attacks in San Bernardino, Boston or Fort Hood. He was right. But now, instead of condemning mass surveillance, he’s leading the pack. 

Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, discussed Cruz in an interview with the <em>[Houston Press](http://www.houstonpress.com/news/ted-cruz-wants-to-patrol-and-secure-american-muslim-communities-get-ready-houston-8263522)</em>. “It’s shocking that a presidential candidate would target Americans just because of their religious affiliation,” Awad said. “It is unconstitutional, un-American and unbefitting for one of the leading presidential candidates to spread fear, hysteria and discriminate against Muslim Americans. His statement should be condemned by all Americans.”

Cruz isn’t the only politician trying to rationalize the United States’ shameful surveillance of Muslims and other marginalized communities. In response to the Brussels attacks, Donald Trump called for tight border restrictions and endorsed illegal waterboarding techniques in the name of national security. While Secretary Hillary Clinton criticized Cruz’s proposal, [she said](http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2016/03/hillary_clinton_calls_for_more.html) “We have to toughen our surveillance, our interception of communication.”

Historians and activists alike have documented the discriminatory nature of U.S. surveillance programs. Consider the now defunct NYPD’s [Muslim surveillance program](https://www.aclu.org/factsheet-nypd-muslim-surveillance-program). According to the ACLU, “The NYPD’s suspicionless surveillance program ... swept up Muslim communities throughout New York City, as well as every mosque within [100 miles](http://www.ap.org/Content/AP-In-The-News/2011/With-CIA-help-NYPD-moves-covertly-in-Muslim-areas) of New York, and [extended](http://www.ap.org/Content/AP-In-The-News/2012/NYPD-monitored-Muslim-students-all-over-Northeast) to Pennsylvania, Connecticut, New Jersey, and more.” The results? Stigma, disruption of religious practices, fear, self-censorship and damaging relationships with law enforcement. This is the kind of program Cruz wants. While a [lawsuit](https://www.aclu.org/cases/raza-v-city-new-york-legal-challenge-nypd-muslim-surveillance-program) shut down the NYPD program, it’s significant that it began in the wake of 9/11 in the name of safety and security. 

Surveillance and technology go hand in hand. Communities of color — specifically Muslim and Black communities — bear the brunt of this kind of undue surveillance. It’s important to note that unwarranted government surveillance doesn’t make us safer. It makes everyone less safe and secure, and these violations of the right to privacy harm those who are targeted. 

And the programs rolled out in vulnerable communities inevitably spread to the rest of the population. Law enforcement uses surveillance technologies to track people online, using Internet searches and social media posts. They also intercept and use [cellphone-location data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.colorofchange.org/images/FinalStingrayLetter_3-14-2016_45.pdf) to track people’s whereabouts, collecting sensitive location information [even when people aren’t suspected of wrongdoing](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2012/10/22/judge-questions-tools-that-grab-cellphone-data-on-innocent-people/). Most of our personal information is vulnerable to spying from law enforcement.

Earlier this week, Malkia Cyril, the founder and executive director of the Center for Media Justice, wrote in <em>[The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/21/apple-fbi-black-americans-encryption-debate)</em> that people targeted by surveillance are all too often left out of the debates about their very lives. Surveillance programs silence entire communities, force important voices out of the national debate and weaken our democracy. 

Despite all that, Black Lives Matter activists around the country are fighting back. “Black voices, and other voices of color, have long been missing from the debates on government surveillance — but not anymore,” Cyril writes. “We’re here, and we are calling on companies to protect the rights of consumers, and on legislators to protect the rights of residents.”

<em>[The Nation](http://www.thenation.com/article/ted-cruzs-radical-new-proposal-patrol-and-secure-muslim-neighborhoods/)</em> talked with Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU’s national security project. “Profiling people based on their religion or race is blatantly unconstitutional and violates the guarantee of religious protection and religious freedom. … One way to look at it is to replace the word ‘Muslim’ with ‘Jewish,’ ‘Christian,’ ‘African-American,’ or ‘Latino.’ What’s wrong in one context is wrong in others.”

In his response to the attacks in Brussels, Cruz also exploited the debate over undocumented immigration in the U.S., saying, “We need to secure the Southern border to prevent terrorist infiltration.” This language perpetuates racist stereotypes, conflating Latin@s’ mere presence with criminal behavior. 

Using dangerous coded language in the name of safety and security has become all too common on the campaign trail — and what the candidates are saying legitimizes unwarranted surveillance. That’s why Linda Sarsour of MPower Change [drew the link](https://twitter.com/MPOWER_Change/status/712401200331804673) between these racially charged attitudes and Cruz’s call for more surveillance of innocent people.

One thing is clear: Whenever a terrorist attack happens, many people in power call for more surveillance. Right now we need more politicians to stand up against racism and Islamophobia — and for our right to privacy.
