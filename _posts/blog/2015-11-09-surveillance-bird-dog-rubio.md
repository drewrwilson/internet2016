I headed up to Rivier College in Nashua, N.H., with the Internet 2016 campaign last Wednesday to see Sen. Marco Rubio give an hour-long speech and take questions from attendees.

It was an interesting crowd, a lot older than one would expect on a college campus. The place was packed and I ended up with the overflow crowd listening to the event from a chilly patio outside. 

The day before the town hall, Rubio published an [Op-Ed](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/01/27/us-must-heed-lessons-11-to-defeat-enemies-in-terror-war.html) calling for the "permanent" extension of the nation's domestic spying programs. He also said that the government should "implore American technology companies to cooperate with authorities." 

The critical issue of mass surveillance didn't come up at all during the town hall, so as Rubio was leaving, I grabbed the chance to ask him whether he had any plans to protect the privacy of Americans online.

At first he misunderstood what I was asking. His initial answer was about international terrorists hacking into Americans' private data. 

Once I clarified my question, Rubio said that the problems with domestic surveillance "have been heavily exaggerated." Perhaps this is why Rubio &mdash; like fellow presidential candidates Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul &mdash; didn't even show up for the final Senate vote on CISA, a bill that will allow the NSA and other government agencies to [violate Americans' privacy rights](http://www.freepress.net/press-release/107171/free-press-action-fund-condemns-senate-passage-cisa) even further.

Watch my full exchange with Rubio below:
