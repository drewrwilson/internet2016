Donald Trump has just doubled down on plans to “shut down” access to the internet.

This is only the most recent of Trump’s [proposals to roll back everyone’s rights to connect and communicate](https://internet2016.net/blog/trump-shutting-down-internet.html). In a recent [foreign policy speech](https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/DJT_Radical_Islam_Speech.pdf), Trump touched on internet censorship and surveillance – while also calling for “extreme vetting” of immigrants, including ideological testing and halting immigration from countries with “a history of exporting terrorism.”

“We cannot allow the internet to be used as a recruiting tool, and for other purposes, by our enemy – we must shut down their access to this form of communication, and we must do so immediately,” Trump said without specifying how he planned to accomplish this.

Trump’s comments on censorship and surveillance on echo [previous statements](https://internet2016.net/voter-guide/). Late last year, he declared that the government needs to [shut down parts of the Internet](http://time.com/4150891/republican-debate-donald-trump-internet/) in order to keep America safe. He has also said national security forces should "err on the side of security" and supports maintaining the Patriot Act and [continuing mass surveillance](http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/01/politics/donald-trump-nsa-surveillance/) of people both at home and abroad. 

Federal, state and local authorities have [disproportionately used online surveillance data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/02/history-surveillance-and-black-community) to target and intimidate communities of color and political activists. Black Lives Matter activists and protesters — including those who have merely used the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag — have been [singled out by authorities](https://www.newamerica.org/weekly/115/stingray-surveillance/) for online tracking.  

Access to [encryption tools](https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/06/to-the-next-potus-for-communities-of-color-encryption-is-a-civil-right/) and an [open internet](http://www.savetheinternet.com/blog/2016/07/14/ruling-gives-communities-of-color-more-opportunities) is crucial for those struggling for equity and justice. It’s frightening to consider Trump having the power to shut down access for people who seek to share their own stories with the wider world, or document police violence as it happens. 

And we have been [down this road before](https://internet2016.net/blog/trump-mistreatment-press-people-of-color.html). The type of profiling that Trump describes is reminiscent of the notorious COINTELPRO program of the Cold-War era, which systematically targeted those struggling for social justice, particularly in the Black community. 

While [Hillary Clinton](https://internet2016.net/voter-guide/) has repudiated Trump’s bigotry and racism, her ideas about surveillance and censorship aren’t much more enlightened. As a senator, Clinton repeatedly voted for surveillance measures which [disproportionately target communities of color](http://www.freepress.net/blog/2016/08/10/surveillance-is-not-colorblind). 

During the Democratic primary, she called for censoring social media in service of the defeating “jihadists.” As with Trump, Clinton is short on specifics.

Suppressing the free exchange of ideas and targeting people based on their religion or ethnic background are patently un-American. As the election year moves into the home stretch, more Americans need to stand up for our rights to privacy and to freely express ourselves on the open internet.
