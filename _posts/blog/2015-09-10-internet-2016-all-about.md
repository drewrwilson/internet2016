In the battle of good vs. evil (aka people vs. mega-corporations), the people are winning. 

This year has been a wild ride: We secured real Net Neutrality at the FCC and stopped Comcast from taking over Time Warner Cable. These victories are the direct result of millions of people and thousands of companies and organizations coming together to fight for the policies we deserve. 

But debates about the future of the Internet are still swirling in Washington, D.C. Efforts at privacy reform haven’t gone far enough and attempts to bridge the digital divide have been weak. Meanwhile, industry campaigns to crush the FCC’s Net Neutrality rules are ongoing. 

As we head into the election cycle, one thing is clear: We need leaders who will stand up for our rights to connect and communicate. And right now is the perfect opportunity to push candidates to stand up for the open Internet.

Lots of critical issues, from the environment to police brutality, will be in the spotlight in the 2016 presidential campaign. But we also want to see the candidates talking about the future of the greatest tool in history for organizing, commerce and communication: the Internet. 

The Internet 2016 campaign seeks to ensure that anyone who ends up in the Oval Office and other key elected offices advances policies that promote five core principles: access, choice, free speech, openness and privacy. These are the building blocks for public policies that protect and promote the public interest.

Over the next year, we’ll mobilize the millions of people who spoke out for real Net Neutrality, stopped Comcast from taking over Time Warner Cable and are fighting to keep the Internet free from unchecked mass government surveillance.

I recently spoke to a bunch of activists in Iowa and New Hampshire about this campaign and they had a lot to say. As the election season heats up we need to elevate the voices of people who are looking for leaders who care about the future of the Internet — and have the vision to create policies any #InternetVoter can get behind.
