On Tuesday, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton released an “[Initiative on Technology & Innovation](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2016/06/27/hillary-clintons-initiative-on-technology-innovation/)” that outlines her policy priorities on broadband expansion, consumer privacy, internet freedom, economic development and other issues. The highlights of the initiative include a promise to defend and enforce the FCC’s Net Neutrality rules and a desire to close the digital divide.

Clinton’s support for Net Neutrality is significant — we need a president who will fight for the free and open internet and push back against ongoing efforts in Congress to undermine the rules. But while her plan says the right things at a high level on other topics, it so far lacks details when it comes to curbing the ever-rising cost of broadband and protecting the privacy rights of everyday Americans.

As Clinton’s initiative points out, consumers in the United States pay far more for high-speed internet access than residents of many other nations do. The steep cost of access and the outright absence of broadband service in certain rural regions mean, according to one study, that at least [15 percent](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/28/15-of-americans-dont-use-the-internet-who-are-they/) of U.S. adults — roughly 37 million people — aren’t using the internet at all. A 2015 [Pew Research Center study](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/21/home-broadband-2015/) shows that the cost of access is too high, and that this harms low-income people of color and low-income rural residents. The Pew report shows that there’s a persistent digital divide impacting these communities despite the value people place on home broadband service.

Clinton’s commitment to closing that divide by 2020 turns on deepening government investment in federal programs like the FCC’s [Connect America Fund](https://www.fcc.gov/general/connect-america-fund-caf) and instructing federal agencies to consider the full range of connection technologies — e.g., fiber, fixed wireless and satellite — to bring Americans online. Clinton also supports the FCC’s decision to [subsidize home internet access](http://www.freepress.net/press-release/107368/lifeline-upgrade-step-toward-closing-digital-divide) for participants in the FCC’s Lifeline program.

While we at the Free Press Action Fund support the expansion of Lifeline and are pleased to see these commitments, there are shortcomings in Clinton’s plan. First and foremost is this: To make internet access more affordable for all Americans, she needs to address the lack of competition among ISPs.

Clinton supports an Obama administration [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/04/15/executive-order-steps-increase-competition-and-better-inform-consumers) that directs agencies to identify anti-competitive practices and refer those that appear to violate federal antitrust law to the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission. But this order won’t spur competition in the broadband market without much stronger antitrust enforcement and other steps to promote and sustain competition. Antitrust laws are written to protect against a loss of existing competition, but haven’t been used often enough to guard against monopolization. Nor do they provide a mandate or mechanism for these antitrust enforcers to foster new competition. They’re defensive, not proactive.

According to Free Press’ analysis of FCC broadband-deployment data, as of December 2014, only 12 percent of the U.S. population had access to three or more wired broadband providers at speeds above 3 Mbps. That means the rest of us are trapped in a duopoly at best when it comes to getting truly high-speed access at home.

When there’s little to no competition in a given market, prices soar. This may be great for companies selling a product but it’s terrible for the people and the businesses who buy it. Right now tens of millions of Americans can’t afford to access the internet at home to look for jobs, do homework, seek educational opportunities and participate fully in our democracy. We need a president who will promote broadband affordability and choice.

On the surveillance front, Clinton’s tech initiative provides little detail on whether she would work to curb unchecked government surveillance. She supports the [USA Freedom Act](http://www.freepress.net/blog/2015/06/03/usa-freedom-act-passed-now-what), which reined in some NSA surveillance programs but didn’t halt all mass collection of personal data. She also says she rejects the false choice between protecting civil liberties and safeguarding national security. 

Given that, she should advocate for rescinding provisions in the Patriot Act and the FISA Amendments Act that place innocent people under unwarranted surveillance. Dragnet surveillance programs and the targeted surveillance of communities of color and Muslim communities threaten our civil liberties. Mass spying chills speech both online and off. Government attempts to push companies to create encryption backdoors threaten to leave us all much less secure. We need a president who will stand up for our privacy rights.

Now that Secretary Clinton has released her internet and technology priorities we await a similar release from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump. Voters need to know where the candidates stand on these vital issues.
