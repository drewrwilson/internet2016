A few months ago we set out to make the Internet an issue politicians [couldn't afford to ignore](https://personaldemocracy.com/media/time-internet-party).  

Folks on our Internet 2016 team rolled up their sleeves and criss-crossed the country to push back against industry and government efforts to kill Net Neutrality, lock down the Internet, crush press freedom and broaden the digital divide. Our goal: to pressure presidential candidates from all parties to stand up for free speech, access, privacy, choice and openness online.

Check out what we've done so far:

**Led bird-dogging workshops in Iowa and New Hampshire.** Alongside allies like the American Friends Service Committee's Governing Under the Influence project, the ACLU of New Hampshire and One Iowa, we trained activists to ask the candidates pointed questions. We armed participants with info about Internet freedom and made sure they got everything they needed — signs, stickers, copies of the advocacy toolkit and policy platform — to hit the ground running.

**Met with more than a dozen candidates.** Our organizers have been face-to-face with all of the major candidates and most of the others. (You can check out our reports and videos on the [Internet 2016 blog](https://internet2016.net/blog/).)

**Rallied and distributed materials at campaign events.** Here are some images from our visibility work inside and outside the MassMutual Center during a Bernie Sanders campaign rally:

**Talked with #InternetVoters in Iowa and New Hampshire.** Voters expressed concerns like “I don't want to live in a world where the Internet isn't free.” Read more from Free Press Action Fund members [here](https://internet2016.net/blog/don't-want-to-live-in-world-internet-free.html). 

**Developed an [advocacy toolkit](https://internet2016.net/toolkits/).** It includes how-to's and tips for getting active and showing love for the Internet in an election year.

**Rolled out a proactive [policy platform](https://internet2016.net/policyplatform/)** that reflects the principles and priorities of millions of Internet voters. We're working with allies to plan a comprehensive launch and roll-out of the platform to journalists and the candidates themselves. 

**Asked pointed questions online both before and during presidential debates.** Watch Craig Aaron [ask his question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsgBv57cKew), which we submitted to one of the GOP debates. And check out the video organizer Lucia Martínez submitted to MoveOn.org's Democratic Presidential Candidate Forum. Allies like the Center for Media Justice and Demand Progress joined social media actions promoting Internet freedom before and during debates. We also submitted questions for Gov. Martin O'Malley and Carly Fiorina via Twitter during the Iowa Presidential Tech Town Hall.

**Developed rapid-response campaign actions** when candidates got it wrong about the Internet. When Gov. Jeb Bush attacked Net Neutrality, we responded. When Donald Trump said we should "close up the Internet in some way" we were there to [push back](https://internet2016.net/blog/trump-shutting-down-internet.html) and stand up for Internet freedom. Ditto for when Secretary Hillary Clinton spoke of shutting "off the means of communication" for terrorist groups and dismissed concerns over how that would impact freedom of speech for everything else online.

We've got lots going on in the New Year — stay tuned for more updates and [email me](mailto:mcrim@freepress.net) to get involved.
