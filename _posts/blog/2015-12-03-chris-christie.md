A few Girl Scouts stepped up inside a large fire-truck bay to take a picture with Gov. Chris Christie after a town-hall meeting on Monday night. After the Scouts shook hands with Christie I asked a question about his stance on unchecked, unwarranted government surveillance of Americans on the phone and online. 

Amid a handful of media microphones I asked the governor what he'll do to protect our Fourth Amendment rights to keep the government out of our private lives. Unfortunately I didn't get a straight answer.

Christie homed in on the "unwarranted" part of my question and argued that the government isn't listening in on people's phone calls. He said that metadata (the identifying information on our calls) is collected and looked at. If a phone number matches a terrorist number in a database and a judge grants a warrant, he said, then a call can be looked at — but only after a warrant is issued. 

This is incorrect and misleading. A warrant is based on probable cause, a strong standard that protects our privacy. The government is using a much lower standard to gather this information. And a phone number doesn't need to "match" a terrorist's number; there's some wiggle room in how closely related a number must be to a potential suspect. The government can track people several individuals removed from those it's following — this is called "hops" and it can implicate a number of innocent Americans. 

Plus those decisions are made behind closed doors in the controversial FISA court — and I expressed concern about how this collection is done without proper transparency.

Christie ended our conversation by saying that sometimes you've gotta trust the people you elect — which is ironic since politicians and law enforcement have repeatedly lied about the extent of government surveillance programs. 

In his stump speech Christie took us back to Sept. 11 and the days immediately following the tragedy. "If you're too afraid to go to a Friday night football game or a Saturday afternoon baseball game at Fenway Park or Shea Stadium back then, where I used to go," [Christie said](https://wamu.org/programs/all_things_considered/15/12/01/chris_christie_bets_on_new_hampshire_in_gop_presidential_race), "if you're too afraid to do that then nothing else works." 

He played up that fear throughout his speech to the crowded room of supporters wearing "Telling It Like It Is" campaign-slogan stickers and positioned himself as the guy who will keep our country safe. 

But more spying won't keep us safe.

Christie is on the record in support of the Patriot Act and the NSA's metadata-collection program — even though a judge recently ruled that metadata collection is [probably unconstitutional](http://www.cfr.org/united-states/conversation-governor-chris-christie/p37277). Christie has no problem with unchecked spying and also expressed support for using biometric fingerprint tracking. 

All of this makes it hard to "trust" the people in power when it comes to my right to privacy. 

In the wake of the Paris attacks, the heads of the CIA and the FBI have been exploiting public fears to push for more power to track our calls, Web searches and movements. The <em>[New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/opinion/mass-surveillance-isnt-the-answer-to-fighting-terrorism.html)</em> called CIA Director John Brennan's recent statements "a new and disgraceful low." 

And on Monday night Christie seemed cut from the same cloth. We gathered for the town hall inside a large fire department and said the Pledge of Allegiance to a flag on a "Never Forget" 9/11 banner hanging in the station — and Christie continued to stoke fears by talking about tragedies and the need for more security. 

"The single most important responsibility of the president of the United States, in my opinion, is to protect the safety and the security of the American people," he [said](http://www.wnyc.org/story/christie-things-starting-come-together/). "Our world war is happening right now. And it's been happening. It's been happening since Al Qaeda started to do their attacks at embassies overseas, attacking our ships. And it's been going on. And this president got into office and decided that American inaction was always better than American action." 

As the presidential candidates continue visiting New Hampshire, the Internet 2016 team will continue to ask them hard questions about our rights to connect and communicate — and show that #InternetVoters are watching.
