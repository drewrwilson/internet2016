At Wednesday night's Trump rally in Worcester, Massachusetts, Internet 2016 team members encountered lots of protesters and saw many members of the media. But both groups were confined to penned-up areas inside and outside the DCU Center. 

The groups weren't allowed to leave their designated areas, which were set apart from the rest of the attendees. And many attendees expressed distaste for both the protesters and members of the press inside and outside of the building.

Protesters outside the building were kept behind police barricade lines — but that didn't stop attendees from [yelling](https://twitter.com/MaryAliceCrim/status/667427242734174208) at the activists. Protesters inside the building were quickly and forcibly removed, but not before the crowd of 10,000 people chanted "USA!", booed and yelled at them. One protester was even punched in the back of the head and thrown to the ground while the crowd looked on. 

When CNN reporter Noah Gray dared to leave the media pen at the back of the convention center to document protesters unfurling a banner inside the venue, Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told the reporter to [get back in the media pen](https://twitter.com/NoahGrayCNN/status/667182208231211008) and threatened the media credentials Gray used to cover the event. "Inside the pen, or I will pull your credentials. Media goes in the pen," said Lewandowski.

As the [<em>Washington Post</em>](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/18/nine-things-that-happened-during-donald-trumps-visit-to-worcester/) reports, Lewandowski also "turned to campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks and said: "Hey, tell Noah [to] get back in the pen or he's fucking blacklisted." 

This isn't the first time Trump and his staff have clashed with members of the media. Univision journalists including Emmy-winning anchor Jorge Ramos have been removed from his campaign events for doing their jobs. And the candidate clashed with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly after she asked him pointed questions during the first Republican debate. 

Both protesters and the news media have always been important parts of political debates. When both groups are at their best they have the opportunity ask hard questions and document what candidates seeking elected office want to do, what they think and what they plan to do in office. And both use the power of the open Internet to access and share information. In fact, the Internet is an essential tool that helps inform and foster participation in civic and political life. 

But the Internet can be used to oppress as well as to liberate. And politicians have exploited recent tragic world events to call for increased government surveillance of Americans online as well as expanded government control over the network.

As the Washington Post notes, Trump told his supporters at the rally that terrorists could use the Internet as a weapon. "They're using the Internet, and they’re recruiting people," he said. "We've got to take back the Internet because they are taking people. They're literally brainwashing people. They're brainwashing our youth ... We can't let that happen. We have innocent youth, and they are misguided." 

You can't shut down part of the Internet without harming the entire network — and this isn't the answer anyway. Heightened surveillance hurts everyone. Taking away our rights and spying on innocent people won't make us safer. 

Protesters and the press have important roles to play in finding and disseminating information so we can make informed decisions and hold our leaders accountable.

But when protesters and the press are kept behind lines marked out on concrete floors they're not able to fully participate in or cover an event. And when venue staff, local police, the Secret Service and many attendees reinforce those lines, things get dicey very quickly — and safety becomes a real issue.

No one should interfere with protesters' right to assemble. No one should interfere with press freedom. And no politician should be allowed to exploit recent tragedies to violate our right to privacy.

When candidates running for the highest office in the land try to suppress our rights, [everyone should pay attention](http://act.freepress.net/sign/internet_surveillance_tragedy/?source=blog).
