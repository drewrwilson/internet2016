People are fired up about the future of the Internet — and they’re using their voices to create change. 

In August, folks met with their members of Congress to urge them to protect the open Internet. They’re spreading the word online about privacy breaches, weak attempts to bridge the digital divide and industry efforts to crush the FCC’s Net Neutrality rules.

These activists are among the millions of people who took Washington to task and secured real Net Neutrality, stopped Comcast’s bid to take over Time Warner Cable and are fighting to end unchecked government surveillance. 

Now they want to know who among the presidential contenders will stand up for their rights to connect and communicate. They want policies that promote access, choice, free speech, openness and privacy online. 

I recently had the opportunity to talk with some activists from Iowa and New Hampshire. Check out their inspiring words below:

“Access to the Internet is essential for my work with a tiny nonprofit in rural Iowa,” said Iowa resident Cherie. “I also use the Internet to promote my art. I’m lucky enough to have a local cooperative phone company that provides fiber, but overall access in the state is like Swiss cheese — whether you get connected depends on where you live.” 

Fellow Iowa resident Holly has studied media and communications. She’s helping a Low Power FM radio station get off the ground and says that “open access to the Internet is critical” to her work.

Comcast customer Sid in New Hampshire told me about his experience with the company. “My monthly bill has more than doubled in the past year — but I don’t have Wi-Fi at home. In fact, I use the Wi-Fi from the church that’s a block away. I’m a retiree and I’m really concerned about the cost of cable and Internet. I’m not hurting but I look at my pennies a little harder than I used to and I don’t want to see them all go shooting off to Comcast.” 

“I’m terribly concerned that we will not have a democracy if we have an undereducated or under-informed populous,” said Ruth from New Hampshire as she reflected on the Internet’s importance. “People are blindsided by advertising, false information, material things that aren’t going to help us be healthier, wealthier or wiser. We need hard-hitting news and information.” 

“You can’t rely on the mass media to tell you what’s going on so the Internet is becoming more and more important,” said Tom, a fellow New Hampshire resident. “That’s a major reason why I support Free Press and similar organizations. The Internet should be free and not controlled by a few large corporations.”

“Is the Internet going to be free for everyone, or something that corporations can manipulate to keep people from having free access?” said New Hampshire resident Jonathan. “I don’t want to live in a world where the Internet isn’t free.”
