At the age of 12 I was put in front of a mic and told that my voice mattered. At the time, I didn’t understand that this was a radical subversion of the status quo, yet I did know there was something unique about my experience. This was not something that happened to other young Chicanas from working-class backgrounds. And so I picked up the mic and ran with it. 

I became one of the first participants in [Generation Justice](http://www.generationjustice.org/), a youth journalism and social justice project based in Albuquerque. In a city where youth of color are habitually criminalized, in a nation that continues to prioritize white, male and upper-class narratives, I was given the opportunity to find my own voice. I produced and participated in radio, video and print pieces discussing Chican@ identity, rape culture and activism in the Albuquerque community.

Ten years later, it’s clear to me how important it is for communities of color to have access to platforms on which we can tell our own stories. We must be able to challenge mainstream narratives and construct a culture shift away from a status quo that devalues our lives and experiences.

Mainstream media outlets have long misrepresented us and propagated stereotypes that dehumanize our bodies. These outlets have failed people of color, probably because they were never designed to include our voices in the first place. It’s no coincidence that people of color own a meager [7 percent of commercial radio licenses and 3 percent of television licenses](http://www.freepress.net/diversity-media-ownership) in the United States.

Without access to mainstream media outlets, the alternative is to create our own media, something that’s feasible only with an open, accessible and nondiscriminatory Internet. 

Having access to the Internet and the tools we need to tell our own stories gives us access to power. There’s a reason #BlackLivesMatter began as a hashtag and then transformed into a movement — because the Internet allows black activists to speak their truth to power in a way the mainstream media does not. 

This is why I’m an organizer for the [Internet 2016 campaign](https://internet2016.net). The Free Press Action Fund launched this effort to push presidential candidates to protect the open Internet. We need candidates to stand up to the big phone and cable companies and fight for the principles of [free speech, access, choice, privacy and openness online](https://internet2016.net/policyplatform/). Where can these candidates start? By making broadband affordable to all.

I fight so that people of color, youth, women, immigrants, queer and trans communities, differently abled people, those who are undocumented — as well as everyone who lies at the many intersections of these identities — can have access to a mic and run with it. 

Join me in this fight: Urge all of the candidates to [stand up for the open Internet](http://act.freepress.net/sign/internet_2016_nn/?source=2016blog).
