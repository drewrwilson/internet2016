Last Friday I headed up to the Franklin, New Hampshire VFW post with the Internet 2016 campaign to see Jeb Bush at a town-hall meeting. 

An audience of around 50 people filled the small VFW hall. The crowd was largely comprised of Vietnam-era veterans along with a few World War II-era vets who had many concerns and questions about Gov. Bush's plans to address national security, the military and particularly reforming the Veterans Administration. 

Much of what Bush had to say about security had to do with "rebuilding" the United States military and carrying a big stick to intimidate others so that military force wouldn't be necessary. 

The Internet 2016 crew was able to get a question in directly after the event when Bush was shaking hands with attendees. When he got to our section of the crowd my colleague Mary Alice Crim struck up a brief conversation with him as I pulled out my phone to record the interaction. She acknowledged his earlier remarks about security and shared her related concern about unwarranted mass surveillance of Americans on the phone and online.

Mary Alice then asked Bush what he would do to protect our Fourth Amendment rights and keep the government out of our private lives. 

Bush had a brief and vague response to this question, saying that we need to take a "balanced" approach to protecting the homeland and the privacy of Americans. Although this might seem reasonable it's hard to believe. Bush is on record supporting the [Patriot Act](http://www.nationaljournal.com/s/31612/jeb-bush-defends-nsa-mass-surveillance-hugely-important_)and the [NSA's bulk collection of data](http://www.newsweek.com/after-paris-attacks-jeb-bush-calls-reinstatement-nsa-data-sweeps-394861) — neither of which reflect a "balanced" approach to surveillance.

After Gov. Bush answered Mary Alice's question and shook her hand he turned to me once I had stopped recording the exchange. He then said in a snarky tone: "You get that all on video?"

I quickly put my hand out for a shake to ease the tension and we shook hands. He didn't appreciate my camera recording the 30-second exchange, but countless cameras, including about 10 from members of the press, had recorded him that morning. As a public figure who regularly hosts public events Bush needs to be accessible to all — and I needed to document his response to a question about vital constitutional protections. 

All presidential candidates need to [take our privacy rights seriously](http://act.freepress.net/sign/internet_surveillance_tragedy/?source=internet2016) — and that means they need to share their views openly on the campaign trail.
