WASHINGTON — Presidential candidate and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has released a series of policy proposals that include a call to roll back Net Neutrality protections. These proposals are riddled with errors — for one, Bush misleadingly claims that the Net Neutrality rules are causing ISPs “to cut back on investments to upgrade and expand their networks.”

Bush also suggests that agencies like the Federal Communications Commission “conduct their deliberations in relative obscurity, often outside of the public’s view” — while failing to recognize that the FCC’s process elicited more than 4 million public comments on this vital issue.

Free Press Action Fund President and CEO Craig Aaron made the following statement:

“The Free Press Action Fund encourages all candidates to clarify their positions on the policy issues that have inspired tens of millions of Americans to take action in defense of an open Internet. Recent polling found that a majority of conservative voters support Net Neutrality, and it’s important that they and others know where would-be policymakers stand.

“Unfortunately, Governor Bush is siding with the phone and cable lobby against the public. His opposition to Net Neutrality is misguided, and he gets the facts wrong. In reality, the rules are working. Broadband providers and Internet content companies alike are investing, and consumers can rest easy knowing that their rights to connect and communicate are protected.

“While Bush is wrong on Net Neutrality, it’s not too late for him or any other candidate to get on the right side of the issue. The FCC’s Net Neutrality ruling is supported by millions of Americans — and they’re paying close attention to what the candidates are saying about the open Internet.”
