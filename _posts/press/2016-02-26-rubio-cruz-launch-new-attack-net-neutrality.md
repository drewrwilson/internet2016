WASHINGTON — GOP presidential hopefuls Sens. Ted Cruz (R–Texas) and Marco Rubio (R–Florida) have signed on to legislation that would kill the Federal Communications Commission’s Net Neutrality rules, which were approved one year ago today.

The “Restoring Internet Freedom Act,” introduced by Sen. Mike Lee (R–Utah), aims to “prohibit the FCC from reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service and from imposing certain regulations on providers of such service.” On Feb. 26, 2015, the agency voted to reclassify these access providers under Title II of the Communications Act, barring phone and cable companies from blocking or throttling Internet content, or discriminating in favor of certain websites and services over others.

The FCC decision came after more than 4 million people commented at the agency, most in support of the rules. [Public polling](https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/ud-cpc-natagenda2014pr_2014netneutrality.pdf) on the issue shows a majority of people — [from both parties](http://time.com/3578255/conservatives-net-neutrality-poll/) — support Net Neutrality protections.

Free Press Action Fund President and CEO **Craig Aaron** made the following statement:

“If these politicians actually listened to what their constituents are saying, they would join the millions of people who have been outspoken supporters of Net Neutrality. Unfortunately too many members of Congress, where companies like Comcast are used to dictating communications policy, are turning a deaf ear to Internet users everywhere.

“We expect this bill to meet a fate similar to that of other failed congressional efforts to undermine the open Internet. But people everywhere who love the free and open Internet — and vote — should be very concerned that candidates making their case for running the country are so out of step with the public on this crucial issue.

“The Internet is an unrivaled place for free speech, popular organizing and economic innovation, and we can’t let gatekeepers like Comcast and Verizon take that away. Net Neutrality is the law of the land and should remain that way. Now it’s time for Congress and the candidates to work to ensure that everyone has affordable access to a fast and open Internet.”
