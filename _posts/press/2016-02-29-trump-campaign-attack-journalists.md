WASHINGTON — On Monday, a security officer, reported to be a member of the U.S. Secret Service, attacked a journalist who had left a designated “press pen” to photograph protesters as they were being escorted from a Donald Trump campaign rally in Virginia.

An agent “grabbed me by the neck and started choking me and slammed me to the ground,” said TIME photographer Christopher Morris. Several eyewitness videos confirm Morris' account. He was later detained and escorted from the event.

Free Press Action Fund Press Freedom Campaign Director **Mike Rispoli** made the following statement:

“It's appalling and unacceptable for members of the media to be harassed and assaulted while doing their jobs covering the presidential campaigns. Respecting the rights of the press is as much a responsibility of the campaigns as it is of the U.S. Secret Service details assigned to protect the candidates. It's journalists' job to push boundaries, investigate and challenge – that's what the press is required to do in a democracy. Nothing warrants violence against a reporter or other attendee at a campaign rally.

“While some of the other campaigns attempt to contain reporters in pens at these events, the Trump campaign is the worst offender. The president -- or anyone aspiring to that position -- must protect free speech and freedom of the press.”
