## <a name="LTE">Writing Letters to the Editor</a>

**Why Do Letters to the Editor Matter?**

Money carries a lot of weight in Washington, but there’s a more powerful tool for creating change: your story. The more we tell our stories, the more we inspire people to join our cause.

And the best stories are the ones that articulate how issues impact us personally. One of the most useful ways to get your story out in the world is to write a letter to the editor of your local paper. Policymakers, candidates for office and their staffs read these letters to get a sense of what their constituents care about. These letters also sway editorial boards and journalists and help raise awareness in the community.

**Tips & Tricks**

* **Check the specs.** Pay attention to each outlet’s submission requirements. While these vary from outlet to outlet, in general it’s best to make your point in 250–300 words. Be sure to find out what format outlets accept submissions in — whether they prefer snail mail, email or the use of a designated form on the outlet’s website.
* **Be timely.** Hook your letter to something that’s happening in the news. 
Express your feelings, but don’t get mean. Stick to the facts and remember that personal attacks are not effective. Express your frustration in a constructive way.
* **Go local.** You can go local in your analysis even when the issue you’re tackling is national in scope. For example, you could explore how the loss of Net Neutrality protections would affect businesses in your community. 
* **Provide evidence and context.** Don’t assume your audience is familiar with your issue. Illustrate your point with concrete evidence that strengthens your position. Boost your credibility by mentioning anything that makes you especially qualified to discuss this topic.
* **Don’t use form letters.** Some organizations provide sample letters, but it’s much more powerful to tell your story. Be sure to write a separate letter for each outlet you’re targeting.
* **Tailor each letter to the outlet’s audience.** Do your research. Read letters in your target publications on a regular basis to get a sense of each outlet’s style and approach. 

**Publishing Your Letter**
* **Identify your target publications.** Community newspapers and trade publications often carry more influence than a letter placed in a more high-profile publication. And it’s easier to get letters to the editor published in these smaller publications.
* **Call the editor** to ensure your letter has been received. Rather than leave a voicemail, follow up until you speak to a staff member.
* **Amplify your message.** To amplify your message, send a copy of your letter to a group (like the Free Press Action Fund) that advocates for your position. 

**Outline for a Letter to the Editor**
* **Open your letter** with your reason for writing. State the problem that concerns you.
* **Define why this issue is important.** Explain how this problem affects you or others, and explain what will happen if something is/isn’t done.
* **Praise or criticize** what a public official has said or done about the issue. Make a positive or critical statement about a public action related to the issue.
* **Support** your praise or criticism with concrete details.
* **Offer a recommendation.** Discuss what should be done and explain why you think this approach would work.
* **Sign the letter.** Provide your full name, mailing address, email address and phone number (many outlets will want to contact you before publishing). Include any relevant organizational affiliation.

## <a name="visibility">Visibility</a>

Here are some ways to get visible in your community and spread the message about #Internet2016:

 1. **Find prime locations.** Even the smallest town has a high-traffic intersection. Consider places like farmers’ markets, public parks and town halls. 

 1. **Bring signs.** Your signs should include a minimal amount of text so that people walking or driving by can easily read them. Some ideas: “Honk if you <3 the Internet!” and “I Vote + I <3 the Internet.” Go big, go bold!

 1. **Pass out information.** Passing out flyers or other takeaways like stickers is a great way to get your message out. Flyers can include more text than signs but it’s still important to be concise. Try printing flyers on colorful paper to make them stand out.

 1. **Color coordinate.** If you’re working in a group of two or more, wear shirts in the same color — the brighter the better.

 1. **Invite friends.** The more people at your event, the more visible you’ll be.

 1. **Go outside the box.** Props like balloons, costumes and music can help you grab people’s attention. 

 1. **Know the rules.** Determine whether a permit is necessary. A good place to start is your town or city hall.

 1. **Document.** Take pictures! Share them on social media with attendees after the event is over.
 
 1. **Identify next steps.** Encourage your guests to take action on the issues that matter to them most. Brainstorm ideas for action and follow up with people after your event.
