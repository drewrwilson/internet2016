## Here are the steps you need to take to ask a candidate a question:

 1. **Find an event.** Sign up for candidates' email lists to find out about upcoming events near you. Look for other popular events where politicians are likely to show up like community BBQs, ribbon-cutting ceremonies, fairs, town-hall meetings, fundraisers, etc. Check out the Governing Under the Influence site for info on candidate appearances in Iowa and New Hampshire.
 1. **Invite a couple of friends to join you.** It's always more fun to partner with friends and having multiple people prepared to ask questions increases the likelihood that you'll get called on (especially if you split up once you arrive).
 1. **Do some research.** Learn the candidate's position on the issue you'd like to ask them about. Find out if there are instructions for asking questions at the particular event you're attending.
 1. **Pick a question.** LINK TO SAMPLE QUESTIONS, BELOW Be concise and ask for a specific response. Make sure your question is easy to remember and practice asking it out loud.
 1. **Tell us about your plans.** We'll let you know if we can invite people to join you. We can also provide feedback on your questions. Email us at info@freepress.net.
 1. **Arrive early.** Get to the event early so you can be in a position where the presenter can see you and potentially call on you.
 1. **Ask your question.** Ask your question early, and be prepared to follow up if needed. Stand up so you can be seen and heard. If there's a microphone, use it. If not, be sure to project. If there's an opportunity to shake hands or speak with the lawmaker one on one, get in line and ask your question.
 1. **Be polite, clear and concise.** Keep your tone positive.
 1. **Document.** Ask one of your friends to take photos and video of the exchange between you and the candidate so you can share it later. If you get someone on camera, tweet it out with the #Internet2016 hashtag and send it to us at info@freepress.net. If you're unable to use photos or video write down your question and the response and send both to us.
 1. **Talk to the media.** If members of the media are present, aim to share your question with them. Tell them why you wanted to ask it and what you want the candidate to do.
 1. **Follow up.** Follow up with the candidate's staff after the event by calling, emailing or visiting their office. Each situation will be different, but you might want to thank them for responding, press them for a more specific answer, repeat the question or tell the staffer you have a question that you didn’t get to ask. (Don't forget to thank your friends for joining you too!)
 1. **Determine your next steps.** Promote the photos and video via social media. Make plans to ask the same question or a related one at the next event.
