Candidates running for office need to hear from you. Telling them what’s important to you and asking questions about the issues you care about most are great ways to hold them accountable.

Check out these ways to make your voice heard:

 1. <a href="#meet">Set up an in-person meeting.</a>
 1. Call the candidates’ offices and tell them what you think.
 1. <a href="#ask">Ask a question at the next event you go to.</a>

## <a name="meet"></a>How to Schedule a Meeting with the Candidates

**Set Up Your Meeting**

 1. Reach out to your local campaign office and ask for a meeting to discuss Internet issues.
 1. Follow up with the office within three days to confirm they got your request.
 1. Create a list of 5–10 people you can invite to join you at this meeting and email them within five days.
 1. Confirm your meeting with the office and <a href="mailto:info@freepress.net?subject=Internet 2016 in-district meeting follow up">tell us it’s happening</a>. If needed, send a follow-up request to the office and confirm with us as soon as you’ve got a date.
 1. Review our [issue briefs](LINKTK) about free speech, access, privacy, choice and openness. Share them with your invitees.

**Prepare Your Attendees**

Plan a preparation meeting with your fellow participants. This should take place the day before your meeting with the office. During the meeting:
 1. Ask each person to play a role during the meeting with the candidate’s office. Identify a note taker and picture taker. Ask someone to print and bring the issue briefs to leave behind with the office. Ask one person to begin the meeting and introduce the issues at hand.
 1. Identify a pre-meeting location with your invitees and exchange phone numbers.
 1. Email your attendees to confirm the date, time and meeting location as well as the roles that everyone signed up for. Send this email right after your preparation meeting.

**Go To the Meeting**

1. Arrive at the meeting location 15 minutes before your scheduled meeting time. Gather with other attendees and enter the meeting together.
1. Tell your story in the meeting. Make sure everyone has enough time to speak. Take lots of photos, including a group one of everyone assembled.
1. After the meeting, ask everyone to share notes, photos and reflections with each other over email. <a href="mailto:info@freepress.net?subject=Internet 2016 in-district meeting follow up">Share this info with us</a>
1. Send a thank-you note to the person you met with and thank your attendees for joining you.

**After the Meeting**

## <a name="ask"></a>Bird Dogging: How to Ask the Candidates Questions

Asking candidates tough questions in person is a great way to push them to take action.

Here are the steps you need to take to ask a candidate a question:

 1. **Find an event.** Sign up for candidates’ email lists to find out about upcoming events near you. Look for other popular events where politicians are likely to show up like community BBQs, ribbon-cutting ceremonies, fairs, town-hall meetings, fundraisers, etc. Check out the [Governing Under the Influence](http://gui.afsc.org/) site for info on candidate appearances in Iowa and New Hampshire.
 1. **Invite a couple of friends to join you.** It’s always more fun to partner with friends and having multiple people prepared to ask questions increases the likelihood that you’ll get called on (especially if you split up once you arrive).
 1. **Do some research.** Learn the candidate’s position on the issue you’d like to ask them about. Find out if there are instructions for asking questions at the particular event you’re attending.
 1. <a href="#questions">**Pick a question.**</a> Be concise and ask for a specific response. Make sure your question is easy to remember and practice asking it out loud.
 1. **Tell us about your plans.** We’ll let you know if we can invite people to join you. We can also provide feedback on your questions. <a href="mailto:info@freepress.net?subject=Internet 2016 bird dogging inquiry">Email us</a>.
 1. **Arrive early.** Get to the event early so you can be in a position where the presenter can see you and potentially call on you.
 1. **Ask your question.** Ask your question early, and be prepared to follow up if needed. Stand up so you can be seen and heard. If there’s a microphone, use it. If not, be sure to project. If there’s an opportunity to shake hands or speak with the lawmaker one on one, get in line and ask your question.
 1. **Be polite, clear and concise.** Keep your tone positive.
 1. **Document.** Ask one of your friends to take photos and video of the exchange between you and the candidate so you can share it later. If you get someone on camera, tweet it out with the #Internet2016 hashtag and <a href="mailto:info@freepress.net?subject=Internet 2016 bird dogging follow up">send it to us</a>. If you’re unable to use photos or video write down your question and the response and send both to us.
 1. **Talk to the media.** If members of the media are present, aim to share your question with them. Tell them why you wanted to ask it and what you want the candidate to do.
 1. **Follow up.** Follow up with the candidate’s staff after the event by calling, emailing or visiting their office. Each situation will be different, but you might want to thank them for responding, press them for a more specific answer, repeat the question or tell the staffer you have a question that you didn’t get to ask. (Don’t forget to thank your friends for joining you too!)
 1. **Determine your next steps.** Promote the photos and video via social media. Make plans to ask the same question or a related one at the next event.
