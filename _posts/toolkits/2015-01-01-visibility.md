Here are some ways to get visible in your community and spread the message about #Internet2016:

 1. Find prime locations. Even the smallest town has a high-traffic intersection. Consider places like farmers’ markets, public parks and town halls.
 1. Bring signs. Your signs should include a minimal amount of text so that people walking or driving by can easily read them. Some ideas: “Honk if you <3 the Internet!” and “I Vote + I <3 the Internet.” Go big, go bold!
 1. Pass out information. Passing out flyers or other takeaways like stickers is a great way to get your message out. Flyers can include more text than signs but it’s still important to be concise. Try printing flyers on colorful paper to make them stand out.
 1. Color coordinate. If you’re working in a group of two or more, wear shirts in the same color — the brighter the better.
 1. Invite friends. The more people at your event, the more visible you’ll be.
 1. Go outside the box. Props like balloons, costumes and music can help you grab people’s attention.
 1. Know the rules. Determine whether a permit is necessary. A good place to start is your town or city hall.
