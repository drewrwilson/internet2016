## Teaming Up With Others

There are a lot of people working to change our world and that’s great — we need it. From time to time we’ll find ourselves doing similar work in similar spaces with other movement leaders. That provides us with an opportunity to work together toward our shared goals of making change.

Here are some <a href="#collaborate">tips on how to collaborate with others</a>.

One of the most visible movements today is the movement for black lives. Activists are pressuring candidates to speak out and we will likely be doing similar work in similar spaces.

We believe that it’s impossible to achieve any kind of social justice without first addressing and dismantling systemic racism. Here is the [Free Press Action Fund’s statement in support of #BlackLivesMatter](http://internet2016/blog/we-stand-blacklivesmatter/).

## <a name="collaborate">How To Be A Good Partner</a>

From time to time we’ll find ourselves doing similar work in similar spaces with other movement leaders. That gives us an opportunity to work together toward our shared goals of making change.

Here are some best practices for being a good partner:

 1. Be kind and respectful.
 1. Remember that humility goes a long way.
 1. Listen to feedback and advice.
 1. Avoid speaking over others. (In other words, listen.)
 1. Communicate clearly and directly. Avoid jargon and abbreviations.
 1. Identify and focus on shared goals.
 1. When possible, pool resources. Recognize that not everyone has the same resources to offer.
 1. Be aware of power dynamics — particularly as they relate to race, gender, sexuality and ability. Much has been written about being a good ally and recognizing privilege. For starters, [check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dg86g-QlM0).
 1. Be inclusive.
 1. If tensions arise and you misstep, apologize. Take steps to address the issue going forward.
 1. Step up when asked, step back when asked.
 1. Get creative — and have fun!
