# Internet 2016
This is the website for [Internet2016](http://Internet2016.net), a campaign to put Internet issues on the national agenda during 2016 US presidential elections. No matter who is elected, we need the next president of the US to voice his or her support for the free and open Internet.

## Tech details
This is a [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) website hosted on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). Jekyll is a static site generator that uses the [Liquid templating system](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki). Content is written in markdown and there are layout templates that jekyll uses to generate static pages.

### How to run this website locally
Running this project locally allows you to make changes and preview them before you push them to the live site.

18 Million Rising has a very good [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/18mr/documentation/blob/master/local-site.md) that explains how to install jekyll, fork a repository on github and run a jekyll project locally. This website follows the same pattern, so I recommend going through that guide to get going.

## How do I give feedback & suggest changes?
The principles expressed on this site are about keeping the web free & open, so the principles themselves are also free & open. You are encouraged to participate in this. Check out the policy platform and share your thoughts. We welcome feedback, comments, suggested changes, remixes, etc.

### But, how?
* **Familiar with github?** The best way to contribute content is to send a pull request with your suggestions. If you're not sure how to do that don't sweat it. See below.
* **Not familiar with github?** You can leave a comment on this page by clicking on the `Issues` tab on the right and adding a New Issue (that's just like a comment). FYI you'll need to create a github account.


## Can I contribute code?
Yes, please! Check out [the issues list](https://github.com/freepress/internet2016/issues) and if you can help, please jump right in!

## Can my organization join?
Maybe/probably. There will be a more formal way to do this the future, but for now if you have an organization/company/club whatever and you want to join this campaign, you can [add an issue](https://github.com/freepress/internet2016/issues/new) here on github indicating that you're interested with the name of your org and how to contact you.
